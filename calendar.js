The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes].

Finally we will cover how to write your own functions to extend the functionality of Drill.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgivre\">Charles Givre</a> is an unapologetic data geek who is passionate about helping others learn about data science and become passionate about it themselves. For the\u00a0last five years, Charles has worked as a data scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton for various government clients and has done some really neat data science work along\u00a0the way, hopefully saving US taxpayers some money. Most of his work has been in developing meaningful metrics to assess how well the workforce is performing. For\u00a0the last two years, Charles has been part of the management team for one of Booze Allen Hamilton\u2019s largest analytic contracts, where he was tasked with increasing\u00a0the amount of data science on the contract\u2014both in terms of tasks and people.Even more than the data science work, Charles loves learning about and teaching new\u00a0technologies and techniques. He has been instrumental in bringing Python scripting to both his government clients and the analytic workforce and has developed a\u00a040-hour Introduction to Analytic Scripting class for that purpose. Additionally, Charles has developed a 60-hour Fundamentals of Data Science class, which he has\u00a0taught to Booz Allen staff, government civilians, and US military personnel around the world. Charles has a master\u2019s degree from Brandeis University, two bachelor\u2019s\u00a0degrees from the University of Arizona, and various IT security certifications. In his nonexistent spare time, he plays trombone, spends time with his family, and works\u00a0on restoring British sports cars.
