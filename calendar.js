The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

Countless books, tutorials and classes have helped individuals master the technical skills necessary to build graphics and images. The difficulty some encounter is converting these technical skills into monetary rewards and benefits. The difficulty can come from finding paid freelance work, seeking a raise from your current employer for your talents, or seeking job opportunities solely focused on data visualization. A few simple concepts can help your clients and employer better appreciate and compensate you based on your ability to design and develop effective data visualizations.\u00a0</p> <p><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAI-AAAAJGQ0YzIzZGMzLWEzYzYtNDA1NC05Mjc5LWQ3ODBjYzQ5NGQ0NA.jpg\" /></p> <p>Shay Anderson currently works for PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Forensic Services: Investigative Analytics practice in Washington, DC where he helps clients\u2019 model solutions in response to natural disasters, government regulation, accusations of fraud, potential litigation, and even sophisticated cyber-attacks. Before joining PwC Shay had over 15 years of experience in the fields of financial, data and business analysis, and has worked with Fortune 500 companies, state and federal agencies, small businesses, as well as the US military. Shay earned his first graduate degree in Information Management from the University of Maryland College of Information Studies (iSchool) where his thesis project on effective dashboard design and development received the Dean\u2019s Award for Outstanding Development or Design (2011). \u00a0Shay just recently completed his second graduate degree in Information Visualization from the Maryland Institute College of Art (2015).</p> <p>Staff Sergeant Shay Anderson was Honorably Discharged from the Army National Guard after 15 years of service. He has over two decades of experience in crisis leadership and data visualization. Shay joined the Washington National Guard at seventeen where he was a member of the HHB 2-146 (Field Artillery) which supported the 81st Infantry Brigade. \u00a0Shay served his community and country in peacetime, in the early 90s SSG Anderson was awarded a Washington National Guard Emergency Service Military Ribbon for his courage in fighting wildfires, and in wartime during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and 2004, for his display of leadership and courage as Sergeant of the Guard commanding security forces at Camps Wolverine and Spearhead in Kuwait. In 2004 he was awarded the Army Commendation Medal.</p> <p>Shay\u2019s proudest moment of national service was in 2003 as a Squad Leader for non-combat soldiers training to become a motorized infantry squad, which upon deployment became responsible for providing security to men and material traveling into and out of Iraq during the first year of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Or are you a data science/ML/AI guru who can't get enough of Major League Baseball?</p> <p>The Baseball Analytics Hackathon, hosted by the Baltimore Orioles and Booz Allen Hamilton, is the perfect opportunity to work with baseball executives and data scientists to refine your data science and analytic skills and show off your creativity by finding new ways to change the game. Hackathon participants will work to develop innovative data science and visualization solutions using unique datasets that we will provide alongside anything else that is openly available on the Internet. We hope that bringing together creative minds in a competitive environment will lead to novel solutions to some of the questions that the baseball industry is trying to answer.</p> <p>Please register at\u00a0<a href=\"http://baseballhackathon.eventbrite.com/\">baseballhackathon.eventbrite.com</a></p> <p>Please e-mail Kevin Tenenbaum at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a>\u00a0with any questions.</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!
