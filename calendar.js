The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

Matt Conway will talk about his Data Science for Social Good Fellowship work, where he applied Data Science techniques to properties in Memphis, and Jorge Mejia from UMD will talk about a project that used Natural Language to help indentify restaurants at risk of closure.\u00a0</p> <p>Do you have a project that uses machine learning to understand your city?

This summer, he was fellow in the Data Science for Social Good program at the University of Chicago, where he worked with an interdisciplinary team applying data science to issues of housing distress and abandonment in Memphis, Tennessee. He is now a transport analyst and software developer in Washington, DC.</p> <p><i>Abstract</i>: Many American cities are facing issues of housing distress and abandonment as the economy evolves. One of the issues faced by these cities is simply knowing where distressed properties are. This information is generally collected using windshield surveys, driving down every street in the city and noting distressed properties. Since these surveys are expensive, they cannot be performed often. Our team applied a random forest to identify distressed properties based on administrative data that is already collected annually, such as tax assessments and building permits.</p> <p><br/>More Than Just Words: On Discovering Themes in Online Reviews to Explain Restaurant Closures</p> <p><i>Bio</i>: Jorge Mejia is fourth-year PhD candidate in the Decision, Operations and Information Technologies (DO&amp;IT) Department at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. He holds a BS in Computer Engineering and a MS in Electronic Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology. Jorge's\u00a0research focuses on social contagion -- measuring and managing how information diffusion affects consumer behavior and business outcomes. Please visit a recent profile from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/news/phd-candidate-profile-jorge-mejia\">University of Maryland.</a></p> <p><i>Abstract</i>: In this study, we complement the existing research on online business reviews by proposing a novel use of modern text analysis methods to uncover the semantic structure of online reviews and assess their impact on the survival of merchants in the marketplace. We analyze online reviews from 2005 to 2013 for restaurants in a major metropolitan area in the United States and find that variables capturing semantic structure within review text are important predictors of the survival of restaurants, a relationship that has not been explored in the extant literature. We combined machine learning approaches and econometric modeling to derive predictive models that are significantly better than models that simply include numerical information from reviews such as review valence, volume, word counts and readability.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n<b>Sponsors:</b></p> <p>This event is sponsored by the\u00a0<a href=\"http://business.gwu.edu/decisionsciences/\">GWU Department of Decision Sciences</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.informit.com/\">Pearson/InformIT</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/12YljkP\">Statistics.com</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://novetta.com/\">Novetta Solutions</a>.

He has also increased OSHA's focus and capabilities in the areas of data analysis and program evaluation.</p> <p>Dr. Michaels is an epidemiologist, currently on leave from his position as Professor of Environmental and Occupational Health at the George Washington University School of Public Health. He is the author of studies examining the health of construction workers, printers, bus drivers and other occupations, as well as of numerous publications on science and regulatory policy.</p> <p>From 1998 to 2001, Dr. Michaels served as Assistant Secretary of Energy for Environment, Safety and Health. In that position, he was the chief architect of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, the historic initiative to compensate nuclear weapons workers who contracted occupational illnesses as a result of exposure to radiation, beryllium and other hazards. The program has provided more than $10 billion in compensation to sick workers and the families of deceased workers.</p> <p>In 2006, Dr. Michaels was awarded the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award, and, in 2009, the John P. McGovern Science and Society Award given by Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society, for his work in scientific integrity and for gaining compensation for nuclear weapons workers.</p> <p>He is a graduate of the City College of New York, and holds an MPH (Master of Public Health) and PhD from Columbia University.</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\nSee you at the meetup!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup! We'll start close to seven. There may be a couple beers. It's going to be fun! :) Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",
