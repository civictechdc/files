In the meantime, a quiet \"evolution\" is occurring, as new digital tools are being integrated into traditional practice settings at a rapid pace. Inside forward-looking law firms and corporate legal departments, lawyers are creating technology-based solutions to increase the effectiveness of legal services. These lawyers are maintaining the highest quality of services while using technologies as a multiplier to drive down client costs.\u00a0</p> <p>This important day-and-a-half conference, sponsored with the ABA Journal, examines how legal technologies are being adopted in many practice areas including litigation, transactional work, compliance, and intellectual property. Each panel's presenters will demonstrate how a new technology they have developed supports improved service delivery. Attendees will have the opportunity to learn how law firms and legal departments are using technology-based tools to address client needs and explore how these approaches enhance the effectiveness of law practice.\u00a0</p> <p>The conference opens with the Iron Tech Lawyer competition on April 22nd from 1:15-3:30 and continues through April 23rd, with panels on technologies in litigation, digital tools in contract management, due diligence, and intellectual property, cross-practice technologies, legal technology careers, and access to justice and open government.\u00a0</p> <p>REGISTRATION = $45 for members of DC Legal Hackers.\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.law.georgetown.edu/continuing-legal-education/programs/academic-conferences/Legal-Tech.cfm\">YOU MUST REGISTER HERE.\u00a0</a></p>",

Prof.\u00a0Naren Ramakrishnan and Dr. Jay Ulfelder will talk about how they've tackled the problem of integrating diverse, noisy data sets and used statistical and machine learning tools to forecast events such as disease outbreaks and political protests. If you're looking to learn about real-world data science, it doesn't get any more real-world than this.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a06:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements, Give-aways</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:15pm -- Presentations and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>TBA</i>)</p> <p><b>Talks:</b></p> <p><i>Forecasting Atrocities</i></p> <p>(abstract pending)</p> <p>Jay Ulfelder is a political scientist whose research interests include democratization, political violence, social unrest, state collapse, and forecasting methods. He received his Ph.D. in from Stanford University in 1997 and his B.A. in Comparative Area Studies (USSR and Eastern Europe) from Duke University in 1991. From 2001 to 2011, Ulfelder served as research director for the Political Instability Task Force, a U.S. government-funded research program that develops statistical models to forecast various political events around the world. He now makes a living as a consulting researcher and has spent most of the past three years working with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Center for the Prevention of Genocide to develop the <a href=\"http://www.earlywarningproject.com/\">Early Warning Project</a>, a public early-warning system for mass atrocities around the world. His blog, <a href=\"https://dartthrowingchimp.wordpress.com/\">Dart-Throwing Chimp</a>, won the International Studies Association's Best Blog (Individual) Award in 2014 and 2015. Follow Jay on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dtchimp\">@dtchimp</a>.</p> <p><br/><i>Beating the news with EMBERS: Forecasting Significant Societal Events using Open Source Indicators</i></p> <p>We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of EMBERS, an automated, 24x7 system for forecasting significant societal events such as disease outbreaks, civil unrest, and elections in countries of Latin America. EMBERS ingests a broad variety of open source datasets such as tweets, news, blogs, economic indicators, and distills them into forecasts. Unlike retrospective studies, EMBERS has been making forecasts into the future since Nov 2012 which have been evaluated by an independent team. Of note, EMBERS has successfully forecast the June 2013 protests in Brazil, the Feb 2014 violent protests in Venezuela, and Hantavirus outbreaks in Chile and Argentina. We outline the system architecture of EMBERS, individual models that leverage specific data sources, and a fusion and suppression engine that supports trading off specific evaluation criteria.\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ramakris/\">Naren Ramakrishnan</a> is the Thomas L. Phillips Professor of Engineering at Virginia Tech in Arlington, VA, and director of the university's Discovery Analytics Center. His work has been featured in many venues including the Wall Street Journal, Popular Science, Newsweek, The Chronicle of Higher Education, and Smithsonian Magazine.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

BYO-Projects and laptops for a fun, informal way to learn,\u00a0code\u00a0and work on projects with other members in the community. From Ruby on Rails to Javascript to CodeAcademy and HTML/CSS, these events are open to all women or those who support women and minorities in tech. Feel free to come early or stay later. These events are held at public\u00a0coffee\u00a0shops, so good seats are on a first come first serve basis. Beginners welcome!</p> <p>Code\u00a0&amp; Coffees are not coding workshops. No instructors, no agenda, no lesson plan. These events are very informal so ladies will usually bring their own projects or meet people who are working on similar projects to collaborate together. If you're a beginner we recommend some online tutorials like\u00a0Code\u00a0Academy or General Assembly Dash. The hope is that you will find ladies who are learning similar coding languages and projects to work with or ask questions.</p> <p>When you arrive, we'll be around the tables/booths in the back. Look for a few signs. If you can't find us, tweet @DCFemTech and we'll do our best to find you.</p> <p>Code\u00a0&amp; Coffees are sponsored by @DCfemtech, @WomenWhoCodeDC, @LadiesWhoCode DC, @RailsGirlsDC, @GirlDevelopItDC and @PyLadiesDC. Check out their individual pages for resources and more events throughout the month!</p>",

            "description": "<p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p> <p>This talk serves as an extremely basic introduction to retrieving data from Hadoop, with a special focus on HBase (the Hadoop Database). Using Pig, non-developers can gather data from the seemingly unwieldy HBase, freeing them to analyze that data with their tool of choice (e.g., Excel, Python). Note: there\u2019s no getting around coding, but if you can write an Excel formula you can write Pig.\u00a0</p> <p>We will begin with a quick and dirty overview of Hadoop and NoSQL databases, with a specific focus on HBase because its flexible schema presents a challenge to Pig beginners. You will learn how to use some short, very kludgy python in the form of a user defined function (UDF) to get around this problem. By the end of this talk, individuals new to code should feel emboldened to start retrieving data from Hadoop.</p> <p><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Gus Cavanaugh is a recovering business major who once sought recognition as a thought leader without realizing how Orwellian it sounded to lead someone\u2019s thoughts. To that end, he honed his ability to make copies, rush around the office, tie a full windsor knot, and nod his head in a sign of vigorous agreement whenever his seniors sought buy-in around a new strategy of leveraging core competencies. While he has barely risen from his nadir, he no longer views the powerpoint deck as the ultimate expression of business acumen and realizes it can be fun to actually build something rather than just speculate.</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p>6:30 - Food and beverages</p> <p>7:00 - Intro and announcements</p> <p>7:15 - Talk</p> <p>8:30 - Head to Tonic for drinks</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup!
