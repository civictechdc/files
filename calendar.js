This session will introduce the basics of version control, how to use git to keep track of your changes to a project, and using\u00a0GitHub\u00a0(a hosting service) to collaborate with other developers.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Outline of Session:</b></p> <p>You will learn -\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0the basic concepts of version control\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0the differences between git and other version control applications</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0fundamental git commands to track changes to a small project</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0the basics of collaborating on code with other developers\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0 how to use GitHub\u00a0</p> <p>Curriculum is available\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.girldevelopit.com/materials/intro-git-github\">here</a>.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Python - any one of those is great! Doesn't matter. There's no particular language required.</p> <p>You also need to have a willingness to use the command line to execute commands. Don't be scared! We'll show you how.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What to Bring:</b></p> <p>Please bring a laptop and charger to class. A netbook or tablet is NOT a substitute.\u00a0Power outlets and wifi will be provided.

This week the <a href=\"http://cadasta.org\">Cadasta Foundation</a> is in town (all together for the first time)! They are working to build a future where, through technology and community partnership, land and resource rights are universally recognized and protected. They'd like to share what they are working on and things that excite them with the GeoDC community. It's a packed agenda - but they're sticking to our lightening talk theme!\u00a0</p> <p><br/>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eomwandho\">Erick Opiyo</a>: Using GeoODK to document land rights. GeoODK is a mobile data collection application built on top of OpenDataKit. This talk will go over how it works and how it is being used to collect land rights info.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fhpichel\">Frank Pichel</a>: Cadasta is building an open-source platform to help communities document their land rights. Learn more about why land matters and how technology can help.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wonderchook\">Kate Chapman</a>: Imagery is a key aspect to mapping community land boundaries. Learn how imagery is used and what developments are helping reduce costs.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/linzjax\">Lindsey Jacks</a>: Field Papers allows people to easily print atlases, sketch on those maps and then upload them again to transcribe their notes. Recently Cadasta sponsored an internship to redesign the atlas making interface to make it more user friendly. Learn what we did and what we might do next.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lindsay_Joelle\">Lindsay Ferris</a>: Combining maps with open data on land tenure can help paint a clearer picture of property ownership within a country. Cadasta is sponsoring a research fellowship to define open data in land and identify key open government datasets that can strengthen property rights. We\u2019ll share what we\u2019re learning and what we hope to accomplish through this initiative.</p> <p>Join us for what promises to be a fascinating and fabulous night!\u00a0</p>",

She continued working with web design/development in college, where she minored in studio art at Tulane University and went to the Art Institute of Washington.\u00a0</p> <p>She is a graduate of the Front End development program at Iron Yard and\u00a0currently works at <a href=\"http://540.co/\">540.co</a>, where she works to help evangelize APIs and open source software/open data and of course, helps the government #getshitdone (the official motto).</p> <p>Front End Hack Night (FEHN) is a study group where women can come together and help each other learn and understand web development. We welcome devs of all levels and encourage those with more experience to help out those that are just starting.

Presentation signups are here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

One of the current challenges has been to create a new patent search for examiners. The challenge is not only to make patents for the united states available to the examiners, but eventually all of the patent organizations around the world.\u00a0</p> <p>Examiners have a lot of domain knowledge and the way they query the current system must be maintained. It's a little more complicated than boolean queries, and less complicated than natural language search. Rahul will talk about his experience in working on and improving a system built on Java, Scala, Cassandra, Spark, SolR, Dojo, jQuery UI. The goal is for you to understand how large scale organizations deal with changing technology and some business and technology take aways.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Rahul Singh is a technology minded business person and a business minded technologist. As CEO of a company devoted to solving the most difficult problems in streamlining, organizing, and unifying business information, he is responsible for training the team, overseeing and creating technology with the research and development team, and fostering client and service partner relationships.\u00a0</p> <p>Although he\u2019s programmed in over 30 computer languages and has worked with numerous platforms, frameworks, and libraries across all major internet software systems, he likes to spend his time sharpening his skills in information retrieval (search), knowledge management, business information systems, and machine learning to come up with ideas for a smarter, more modern enterprise.</p>",
