Regardless of what we\u2019re designing--a website, an Android app, or a toaster--we all strive to make our designs useful, easy to use, and enjoyable to use. But how exactly do we make something useful, easy to use, and enjoyable? How do we know if the target audience is having a good or bad experience? This class will arm you with the essential tips to find those answers.</p> <p>This class is for anyone who currently makes (or wants to learn how to make) websites, mobile apps, or other software. If you\u2019re a developer, a designer, a project manager, a content creator, or something else, you can integrate UX research and design into your practice.</p> <p>The contents that this class will cover include:</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a0Fundamental concepts of user experience design (what UX is and why you should care)</p> <p>\u2022 Creating user personas</p> <p>\u2022 Identifying usability problems and prioritizing solutions</p> <p>\u2022 How to design and run usability tests</p> <p>\u2022 Getting useful feedback from your users</p> <p>\u2022 Information Architecture and interaction design</p> <p>\u2022 Where UX fits with project management methodologies</p> <p>\u2022 And much, much more!</p> <p>This is a hands on course which will give you actionable tools to get started with user experience in your work day!

All of us are called upon at some point to manipulate a string or two. Regular expressions are a powerful tool that requires some serious logical thinking. We'll talk about why websites, in the year 2014, still require us to type in our phone numbers with their scheme of dashes and parentheses. (Answer: they're bad at regular expressions, but we can do better.) Tips from Python, Bash, and Java should help illustrate practice, and we'll talk theory as well.</p> <p>Then, Elaine leads us through an interview question. We'll practice in groups how to interpret a question, how to think about it, and how to format a response.</p> <p>Pizza arrives around 6:30 and we'll start to introduce ourselves around 7.

Conceived by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman from Stanford, the Lasso performs dimension reduction and variable selection, making it well suited for the high dimensionality of today's datasets. In this talk, Jared will go over some of the math behind the Lasso and discuss some recent advancements in performing statistical inference on Lasso-fitted models. He will also show the R code behind the results.

Or are you using big data already and want to hear how other people are making it work for them? Join us to learn more about how some major organizations are making an impact using big data.\u00a0Schedule</p> <p><br/>6:00pm - 6:40pm Networking</p> <p><br/>6:40pm - 6:50pm Introductions</p> <p><br/>6:50pm - 8:15pm Speakers</p> <p><br/>Talks and Speakers (more coming soon)</p> <p>\u00a0\u201cData Warehousing at Opower\u201d</p> <p>Arjun Dasgupta, Opower, Research Engineer</p> <p>Arjun is a research engineer at Opower working on Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing. Over the last few years, he has led Opower's DW and BI initiatives. He has played an important part in architecting Opower's hadoop based data warehouse and tackling data scale, governance and integration issues. Prior to Opower, Arjun spent time in academia researching novel problems in databases, data mining and information retrieval.\u00a0</p> <p>Opower has grown from a small startup to a publicly traded company in the last 6 years. Our datasets have also grown exponentially in complexity and scale. In order to tackle this data explosion, we started an initiative to move our enterprise data warehouse to a scalable hadoop ecosystem. The focus was to get all our data in one place, where it could be queried, mined and analyzed at scale. In this talk, I will share our experiences in building this core piece of infrastructure, the benefits that we have reaped and challenges that we have faced along the way.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>\u00a0\u201cHigh Performance Data Warehousing via Open Source\u201d</p> <p>Curtis Smith, \u00a0Neustar , Director, Platform Services \u2013 Implementation and \u00a0Integration</p> <p>Curtis has been instrumental in the creation and development of Neustar\u2019s Data Services organization which is responsible for Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence and over the last 4 years, \u00a0Neustar\u2019s Big Data initiative. He is involved in the creation of both internal and external facing analytic solutions including product offerings. \u00a0He is known for his ability to design, develop and implement processes to effectively collect and transform massive amounts of raw data into useful information and knowledge for Neustar and more importantly their customers. \u00a0 He is an evangelist for innovation through the use of Open Source software and commodity hardware. \u00a0Curtis has over 30 years of progressive software engineering experience with 24 years in the dynamic Communications / Telecommunications industry. \u00a0</p> <p><br/>\u00a0\u201cData2Action Project Outcomes and Achievements\u201d</p> <p>Dr. Fen Zhao, National Science Foundation, AAAS Policy Fellow and Staff Associate at the Office of the Assistant Director for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering</p> <p>As a AAAS Policy Fellow and Staff Associate at the Office of the Assistant Director for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE) at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Fen Zhao focuses on building public-private partnerships around CISE's Big Data, next generation internet, and cybersecurity R&amp;D portfolios. \u00a0During her tenure as a AAAS Fellow, Dr. Zhao also worked at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Big Data and national security S&amp;T issues. \u00a0Prior, Dr. Zhao was an associate with McKinsey and Company\u2019s Risk Management Practice, serving public sector clients in the mortgage and debt markets. \u00a0Fen received a BS in Mathematics for Computer Science and a BS in Physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a PhD in Applied Physics from Stanford University. Her doctoral research was conducted at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, where she developed astrophysical simulations of magnetic fields within the early universe using supercomputers.</p> <p>Abstract: \u00a0Aiming to make the most of the fast-growing volume of digital data, in March 2012, the Obama Administration announced the \u201cBig Data Research and Development Initiative.\u201d By improving our ability to extract knowledge and insights from large and complex collections of digital data, the initiative promises to help solve some the Nation\u2019s most pressing challenges. \u00a0At the launch of the initiative, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and research funding agencies across the federal government (including the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, and many others) announced over $200M in new funding opportunities for Big Data R&amp;D.</p> <p><br/>\u00a0Beginning in the second year of the National Big Data Initiative, the Administration encouraged multiple stakeholders including federal agencies, private industry, academia, state and local government, non-profits, and foundations, to develop and participate in Big Data innovation projects across the country. \u00a0On November 12, 2013, dozens of public and private organizations met at a White House-sponsored \u201cData to Knowledge to Action\u201d event to announce an inspiring array of Big Data related collaborations-- answering President Obama\u2019s call for partnerships that can enhance national priorities, including economic growth and job creation, education and health, energy and sustainability, public safety and national security, and global development. \u00a0In this talk, I will discuss some of the projects launched at the Data2Action their recent outcomes and achievements, focusing on interdisciplinary collaborations that focus on serving public and social good. \u00a0I will also discuss new and continuing Big Data programs being planned by NSF and other agencies in support of Big Data in national priority areas in the next phase of the Initiative.</p>",

Maybe you want to code with other people but are tired of sending zip files back and forth via email? Are you just getting started coding and want to learn best practices for how and where you should save it?</p> <p>This meetup will introduce you to Git, a version control system. This event is perfect for beginners as we'll show you the tool many developers use to collaborate and back up code. If you're a developer and you are not using a version control system, you should come out too as it's an absolute must for a developer's workflow.</p> <p>This event will be hands-on, so we encourage you to bring your laptops as we'll be doing real examples and practicing together. If you want to get ahead of the curve, you can sign up for a free account over at Github.com and start reading some of their documentation.</p>",

Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.</p> <p>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.</p> <p>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?</p> <p>For more information about Maptime, visit maptime.io.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like hyperlapse mashups]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like inverted circuit wallpaper]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

        "description": "<p>With the diverse skills and interests of our group, let's explore how the experience in our backgrounds plays into our tech careers. For January, a founder will share the intersection of her subject matter expertise with tech, discussing how localization (fitting a site or piece of software to a culture, often including language) interacts with design and development. Then, we'll break for some interactive coding fun!</p> <p>Terena Bell is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php\">In Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage\">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p> <p>Say the word \"language\" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p>If you're considering joining, please read our rules, to determine if this group is right for you:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/</a></p>",
