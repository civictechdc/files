The conference is looking for speakers on new, innovative technologies and approaches. Look for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/talllguy\">Elliot</a> to run your idea by him.</p> <p><br/>------</p> <p>This month's GeoDC will look at how open source is entering some of the traditionally most closed off agencies in government, and how anyone can use these applications for their mapping needs.\u00a0</p> <p>Here's our lineup:</p> <p><br/>\u2022 One of the lead developers from <a href=\"https://github.com/ngageoint/mrgeo\">MrGeo</a> will do a deep dive on the open source project and talk about how they open sourced it. MrGeo (MapReduce Geo) is a geospatial toolkit designed to provide raster-based geospatial capabilities that can be performed at scale. MrGeo is built upon the Hadoop ecosystem to leverage the storage and processing of 100\u2019s of commodity computers.</p> <p>\u2022 Chris Rasmussen, Public Software Development Lead at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), will talk about why the NGA started developing code in the open via <a href=\"https://github.com/ngageoint\">Github</a> and the wins they're seeing from the collaborative approach.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022 John Jediny, the Lead for the <a href=\"http://nepanode.anl.gov\">NEPAnode</a> project at the US Department of Energy \u00a0(DOE) will discuss how DOE uses and applies Open Source Geospatial software.\u00a0\u00a0You can check out all of the software used on their <a href=\"https://github.com/DOE-NEPA/\">Github</a> account and\u00a0view some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpgaQ7eH-HJZMkUcrAE-i4A\">videos</a> on their YouTube channel.</p> <p>\u2022 Micah Wengren, IT Specialist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), will talk about an open US Government Interagency effort to collaboratively use Geonode/CKAN.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>Come out at 7pm to grab a drink and bite to eat. We'll kick off introductions and lightning talks at 7:30pm. There will be time after to talk with our speakers and everyone else. Stetsons is a 21 and over venue. If you're not yet 21 but want to attend, message us via meetup and we'll do our best to get you in.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>GeoDC meets on the first Wednesday of the month to learn, network, and talk about the work people are doing with maps, GIS, geodata, and more. Join this meetup group, follow @Geo_DC on Twitter, and join our Google group for updates.</p> <p><br/>Do you have something you'd like to share with the group? Let us know!</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like oregano web services]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

Then, let's get practical and walk through how to launch a web app. For January, a tech founder will share the intersection of her subject matter expertise with tech, discussing how localization (fitting a site or piece of software to a culture, often including language) interacts with design and development. Then, one of our web dev members will show us the simple steps to deploy a web app.</p> <p><b>Terena Bell</b> is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php\">In Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage\">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p> <p>Say the word \"language\" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p><b>Mandy Moore</b> is a Junior Developer at Mobility Labs and a recent graduate of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.\u00a0 In her talk she'll show you how you can share your projects with the world for free by deploying to Heroku using Git.\u00a0 Basic knowledge of Git, a free Heroku account and a small project to deploy will be helpful but not required.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nIf you're considering joining, please read our rules, to determine if this group is right for you:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/</a></p>",

We\u00a0present analysis of mental health phenomena in publicly available\u00a0Twitter data, demonstrating how rigorous application of simple natural\u00a0language processing methods can yield insight into specific disorders\u00a0as well as mental health writ large. What's more, we find evidence\u00a0that as-of-yet undiscovered linguistic signals relevant to mental\u00a0health exist in social media. We present a novel method for gathering\u00a0data for a range of mental illnesses quickly and cheaply, then focus\u00a0on analysis of four in particular: post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD), depression, bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder\u00a0(SAD). We also discuss a hackathon we recently hosted, and an in-progress\u00a0shared task using the data used from these\u00a0investigations.\u00a0We intend for these\u00a0proof-of-concept results, experiments, and explorations to inform the\u00a0necessary ethical discussion regarding the balance between the utility\u00a0of such data and the privacy of mental health related information.</p> <p><br/><b>Speaker</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/glencoppersmith\">Glen</a> is an independent consultant addressing a range of data science challenges -- currently working with the leadership of DARPA's XData program, an affiliate of the Data Guild, and as a part-time research scientist\u00a0at the Human Language Technology\u00a0Center of Excellence at Johns Hopkins University. He joined the HLTCOE in 2008 as the first full-time researcher, staying on full time there until the end of 2014.\u00a0He also maintains assistant research scientist positions within two departments at\u00a0Johns Hopkins: Applied Math and Statistics and Electrical and Computer\u00a0Engineering. His graduate work was at Northeastern University, using computational techniques to explore psychology problems (in linguistics, neuroscience, and clinical psychology). His work spans a number of disciplines: computer science,\u00a0graph theory, statistics, natural language processing, machine\u00a0learning, and psychology. He tends to shy away from curated and\u00a0cared-for datasets, instead preferring the wild-west of real world\u00a0data. He suspects this is in part due to his keen appreciation for the\u00a0outdoors -- an avid rock climber, kayaker, photographer, hiker, and\u00a0SCUBA diver.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!
