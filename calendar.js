We have been performing research with the Laboratory for Physical Sciences on how to apply machine learning to detect malware, and to do so with minimal domain knowledge about binaries and how they work. I\u2019ll be giving an overview about the problem, why its difficult \u2013 especially compared to current ML tasks, and an overview of our current and completed research toward that goal.</p> <p><br/><b>How to Build a Malware Classifier [That Doesn't Suck on Real-world Data] - John Seymour</b></p> <p><br/>Machine learning is the latest trend in malware classification. It's easy enough that now everyone can spin up a malware crawler, extract some features from the files, build some machine learning models, and publish their research in a reputable journal. However, many of these models have issues with overfitting: they have significant accuracy reductions on real-world data. We'll give a full introduction on using machine learning to classify malware, including the features that are currently used, which models seem to work best, and what datasets exist for this purpose. We'll also demonstrate that even the best public malware classifiers overfit to their original training sets. We'll end the talk with forays into avoiding this issue, for creating malware classifiers that don't suck on real-world data.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.edwardraff.com\">Edward Raff</a> is a Computer Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton, specializing in Machine Learning problems and solutions. As the author of the JSAT library, Edward has extensive experience implementing all manner of algorithms. In particular, he has worked on problems involving bioinformatics, signal classification, sentiment analysis, real time object tracking, and change detection. He currently works at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences researching new methods of applying deep learning to cyber security, and in particular malware classification and analysis. Edward holds a Bachelor's and Master's degree from Purdue University, and is working on a Ph.D. at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Ed can be emailed at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a></p> <p><br/>John Seymour is a Data Scientist at ZeroFOX, Inc. by day, and Ph.D. student at UMBC by night. He researches the intersection of machine learning and InfoSec in both roles. He's mostly interested in avoiding and helping others avoid some of the major pitfalls in machine learning, especially in dataset preparation (seriously, do people still use malware datasets from 1998?) He has spoken at BlackHat USA, DEFCON, BSidesLV, and aims to add SecTor to the list in the near future.

You can access it on <a href=\"https://github.com/EdwardRaff/JSAT\">Github</a>. It is a Java library for machine learning, built out of my frustration in using Weka. It aims to provide a more efficient and easier to use API, as well as numerous algorithms. Many of the algorithms in JSAT are independent implementations of common tools (such as linear SVMs, Lasso, and t-SNE) and others are more niche or rarely available methods (such as Kernel k-means and AMM).</p> <p><br/>John has released two security related projects on Github.</p> <p>label-virusshare: A project to label the VirusShare malware corpus using VirusTotal's public API.

This will be in place of a Maptime this month.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.missingmaps.org/\">Missing Maps\u00a0</a>is a humanitarian mapping project with the objective to\u00a0map the most vulnerable places in the developing world, in order that international and local NGOs and individuals can use the maps and data to better respond to crises affecting the areas. We will be mapping areas where the data is literally missing from\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\">OpenStreetMap</a>.\u00a0</p> <p>Mapping beginners are welcome! If you are new to OSM please\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new\">sign up for an account</a>\u00a0beforehand, and if you have some time before the mapathon, there are\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.missingmaps.org/contribute/#learn\">training videos</a>\u00a0to provide some background. At the start of the mapathon we will be going through a short tutorial on OpenStreetMap and the Tasking Manager to get everyone up to speed.\u00a0</p> <p>Please bring a laptop. If you have one, external mouses are handy for easier mapping. Food and drinks will be provided mid-way through the event.</p>",

Currently, popular tools like D3js use SVG to render designs. SVGs can produce really beautiful visualizations, but are limited to the constraints of the DOM. WebGL on the other hand allows you to have direct access to the users GPU and therefore more power and speed for rendering large sets of data.</p> <p>Julia will walk you through her process of learning how to move a D3.js/SVG force chart to webGL using the 2D gaming library Pixi.js.\u00a0Julia will talk about the pros and cons of this method, lessons learned, and show you how to get started with Pixi.js and WebGL visualizations.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Thank you\u00a0</b><b><a href=\"https://generalassemb.ly\">General Assembly</a>\u00a0(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GA_DC\">@GA_DC</a>) and\u00a0<br/></b><b><a href=\"http://www.infernored.com\">InfernoRed Technology</a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/infernoredtech\">@InfernoRedTech</a>) for<br/>sponsoring our event!</b></p>",

Ever wanted to round latitude and longitude to an arbitrary level of precision to make them easier to process but didn't know how? Fortunately, a solution is in sight: geohashing is a technique for compressing geo coordinates and simplify working with them. Join me, Mary Griffus, at Women Who Code: Algorithms on October 24th and you, too, will be able to geohash like a pro. We will discuss use cases for geohashing and the math behind how it works, and write a geohashing algorithm as a codealong (Python and Java will be provided for each step).\u00a0</p> <p>Find material from past algorithm meetups <a href=\"https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/algorithms-community/blob/master/algorithms_study_resources.md\">here</a>.</p> <p>Please arrange to get your own food before the meetup today as there won't be any food provided for today.</p> <p><br/>This event is intended to be exclusively open for women; we are trans* friendly.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>See you there!</p>",
