First, Brandon Bass from\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.navigant.com/energy/\">Navigant Energy</a> will talk about heuristics in optimization, a fundamental component of many machine learning algorithms, and a highly useful set of techniques in their own right. Then, Biplab Pal and Mark Silverman from <a href=\"http://www.treeminer.com/\">Treeminer </a>will talk about an innovative mathematical re-representation of data that allows dramatically faster classification and clustering. Like math? We do too. Join us to learn some new things.</p> <p><br/><b>NOTE:</b> We're up in Microsoft's offices in Chevy Chase this month! If you're taking the Metro, exit North from the Friendship Heights stop. If you're driving, there's a garage underneath the building.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a06:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements, Give-aways</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:15pm -- Presentations and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>TBA</i>)</p> <p><b>Talks:</b></p> <p><i>Heuristic Optimization</i></p> <p>Lots of people use optimization, but do you know what's going on under the hood?\u00a0 Using the right algorithm for your data can drastically improve the accuracy and speed of your analysis.\u00a0 But what if you're unsure of the theoretical properties of your data, such as its convexity or continuity? Heuristic methods of optimization can come to the rescue.\u00a0 We will go through algorithms which are modeled off of how genes are passed throughout generations, to methods which were inspired by animal herd movement. The concepts and mathematical basis of Greedy Search, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithm will be emphasized, and time permitting, we will discuss a few tricks, parallelization and the \"No Free Lunch\" Theorem.</p> <p>Brandon Bass is a Senior Consultant at Navigant Energy, working on development of data-driven web and platform applications and expansion of Navigant's proprietary energy market models. Before Navigant, Brandon worked with Altenex, a Boston-based small business in the energy space, to develop their power market forecasting and risk analytics engine.\u00a0 Brandon completed his Masters in Engineering in Power Systems Engineering and Optimization, and his B.S. in Environmental Engineering, both from Cornell University. Follow him on twitter\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Brandon_D_Bass\">@brandon_d_bass</a>.\u00a0</p> <p><i>Vertical Algebra and Machine Learning</i></p> <p>Organizations today face challenges in performing predictive classification and clustering, driven by the volume, speed, and variety of data. We are pioneering a new approach to these tasks, one based on a novel vertical organization of data.\u00a0 This approach has significant scalability advantages over traditional approaches, and has been implemented in Big Data environments like Hadoop and Storm.\u00a0 We\u2019ll review the mathematical foundations of vertical data mining (vertical \u201calgebra\u201d), and some example classification and auto clustering algorithms that have been implemented using vertical \u201calgebra\u201d.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also review some applications where vertical data organization can provide great benefit.</p> <p><br/>Mark Silverman is the Founder and CEO of Treeminer, Inc., a start-up company tackling the problem of large dataset analytics using Vertical Data Mining techniques.\u00a0Mark has a diverse technology background, including Data Mining and Analytics, IT software and infrastructure, Networking and Security, and Wireless technologies.\u00a0 He co-founded Treeminer with Dr. William Perrizo to bring to market a novel approach to solving the problems of data mining in large datasets.\u00a0 Mark has been intimately involved with the development of the software and algorithms that are at the heart of Vertical Data Mining.\u00a0Mark received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree from Columbia University.</p> <p>Biplab Pal is CTO of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.autopredictivecoding.com/\">Autopredictivecoding LLC</a>\u00a0and Product/Application development manager for Treeminer Inc. Biplab has a PhD in Telecommunication Engineering and he has more than 16 years of experience with modeling of Sensors and Telecom System Engineering Data. Currently he has developed a \u00a0Big Data platform for IoT for mid-sized manufacturing for MRO (Maintenance, Repair &amp; Operation) using Treeeminer's new classification technology.</p> <p><b>Sponsors:</b></p> <p>This event is sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx\">Microsoft</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/12YljkP\">Statistics.com</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://datamininglab.com/\">Elder Research</a>, <a href=\"http://novetta.com/\">Novetta Solutions</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.informit.com/\">Pearson/InformIT</a>.

You should feel comfortable asking questions during the talk when you have them.\u00a0</b>Matt delivered a previous version of this talk to San Francisco's Python meetup to rave reviews in January.\u00a0</p> <p>(If you don't know what async is and want to understand a little more before the talk -- here is an async talk from PyCon 2014: <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014/what-is-async-how-does-it-work-and-when-should-i-use-it-by-a-jesse-jiryu-davis\">Slides </a>&amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WV7juNmyE8\">Video</a>.)</p> <p>\n\niStrategyLabs is hosting will also provide food and drink, so you can come hungry!</p> <p>\n\n\nAgenda:</p> <p>\n\n\n\u2022 6:30-7:00pm - Arrive, eat, and catch up\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 7:00-7:15pm - Announcements\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 7:15-8:15pm - Talk, Q&amp;A\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 8:15-8:30pm - Wrap-up\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 8:30pm - Migrate to a social venue nearby</p> <p>\n\nAbout the talk:</p> <p>\n\nWhy should Node.js folks have all the asynchronous web application fun?\u00a0 In this talk you'll learn how to use WebSockets with Python, Flask and gevent to build full-duplex communications into your web apps. We'll live code from a blank file to a completed app that updates vote counters in a web browser via WebSockets without page refreshes. Along the way you'll learn good practices to follow when working with virtualenv and Python application dependencies.\u00a0</p> <p>About Matt:</p> <p>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/makaimc\">Matt Makai</a>\u00a0(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmakai\">@mattmakai</a>) is a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html\">Twilio Developer Evangelist</a>\u00a0and Python web developer based in Washington, D.C.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!
