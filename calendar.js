Thanks!</p> <p>Note: Potential mentees with the highest skill level will be matched with mentors who have the highest skill level. Which means that potential mentors with the best skill set will get the more advanced mentees. Thus it is in your best interest to show off your current skills so you can work with others who are best positioned to challenge you. Refer to <a href=\"http://github.com/crowdpublishtv/crowdpublishtv\"><a href=\"http://github.com/crowdpublishtv/crowdpublishtv\" class=\"linkified\">http://github.com/crowdpublishtv/crowdpublishtv</a></a> and use tutorials, google, etc. to help you figure out the answers.\u00a0<br/>1. What is the design of the CrowdPublish.TV database? Submit as a jpg or png (You may draw on paper &amp; submit as a photo)<br/>2. Which file/view is the users' home page? What information do authors get to display on their home page? Where is this information stored in the CrowdPublish.TV database?<br/>3. What pages/views do authors get in their web site when they sign up for CrowdPublish.TV?<br/>4. What are the default views for all Rails apps?<br/>5. What are the routes that were added to the CrowdPublish.TV app so the non-default/extra views for user pages could be displayed?<br/>6. What are the methods that were added to the CrowdPublish.TV app so the non-default/extra user views/pages could be displayed? What file are they in?<br/>7. Where is the method to add_bank_account to users? What gem does it use?<br/>8. Fork a copy of the crowdpublishtv github repo (url above) into your github account. Make a minor change that does not affect functionality (such as add a dummy file to the root directory) and request that the CrowdPublishTV admin pull your changes.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>9. Summarize your Ruby &amp; Rails skill level/what you know in your own words.</p> <p>We'll meet on Monday evenings probably from 6:30-8:30 at MLK library or maybe even Optoro.\u00a0</p> <p>This event is for women. Thus it will be lead by women, women will set the topic of discussion,\u00a0women will learn from other women, and women's voices will dominate.\u00a0While men will not be discouraged from attending, the purpose of male attendance will be to support women's leadership in Ruby on Rails web development. Cliff Clavens will not be tolerated :D</p> <p><br/>...</p> <p>RailsGirls has organized several sessions to help get newbies set up with Rails. But what comes next? If you're interested in working on something to improve your skills or interested in helping others on a regular basis, you should come.\u00a0</p> <p>There's something useful in it for all levels of Ruby on Rails users, so I'm excited to figure out how we can all help each other.</p>",

From Ruby on Rails to Javascript to CodeAcademy and HTML/CSS, these events are open to all women or those who support women and minorities in tech. Feel free to come early or stay later. These events are held at public coffee shops, so good seats are on a first come first serve basis. Beginners welcome!</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are not coding workshops. No instructors, no agenda, no lesson plan. These events are very informal so ladies will usually bring their own projects or meet people who are working on similar projects to collaborate together. If you're a beginner we recommend some online tutorials like Code Academy or General Assembly Dash. The hope is that you will find ladies who are learning similar coding languages and projects to work with or ask questions.</p> <p>We'll be in the back part of the bar, at a big communal table. The Coupe's full menu will be available to order from the bartender.</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are sponsored by @DCfemtech, @WomenWhoCodeDC, @LadiesWhoCode DC, @RailsGirlsDC, @GirlDevelopItDC and @PyLadiesDC.

            "description": "<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/hadley/dplyr\">dplyr</a> package for R provides a unified domain-specific language for tabular data. A powerful feature is that it supports multiple sources of tabular data, including data.frames, data.tables, and several dialects of relational database. But data.frames are not databases! How can this work? In this talk, I will dive into the details of how high-level dplyr verbs get translated into SQL, and walk through tips and tricks, optimizations, and gotchas.</p> <p><b>Our Instructor - Harlan Harris</b></p> <p>Data Scientist with experience and skills in Statistics and Statistical Programming, Machine Learning, Enterprise Software, Operations Research, Analytical Marketing, Enterprise Analytics, Higher Education, Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Modeling, Linguistics/Psycholinguistics, Artificial Intelligence, and more.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

Regardless of what we\u2019re designing -- a website, an Android app, or a toaster--we all strive to make our designs useful, easy to use, and enjoyable to use. But how exactly do we make something useful, easy to use, and enjoyable? How do we know if the target audience is having a good or bad experience? This class will arm you with the essential tips to find those answers.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About the Instructor:\u00a0</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/a/9/600_441594697.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Jenny is a UX designer with background in UI design, web development, and painting.\u00a0</p> <p>Fascinated with Human-Computer Interaction, how it affects our daily lives, and how interacting with, and building, technology could improve our lives; Jenny's\u00a0passion is\u00a0making software usable, and bridging the gap between clients and users with developers and technology.</p> <p>Jenny is currently consulting\u00a0with agencies, startups and small businesses on awesome digital projects.

During this talk, Henri will demonstrate how we can use DSS's powerful tools to create a complete workflow from raw data to training models in 1h.</p> <p>We will start by scraping data science related job listings in Washington DC. Then, we will download all of the company reviews and try to make sense of where is the best place to work by cleaning and parsing raw html, and ultimately performing unsupervised learning to see what topics come up!\u00a0</p> <p>Finally we will use DSS's insight tool to create a web app using flask, html and javascript to explore the results.</p> <p><br/><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Henri Dwyer is a data scientist and engineer working at Dataiku on building the best platform for data scientists. He received an MSc in Engineering from Columbia University in New York City, and a BS and an Ms in Engineering from Ecole Polytechnique in Paris.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup!
