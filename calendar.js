We'll be having our second tech talk of the year on Intro to API's with Amanda Hewitt.</p> <p>Amanda started writing code when she was 10 years old, back in the weird-old-days of Geocities and table-based layouts. She continued working with web design/development in college, where she minored in studio art at Tulane University and went to the Art Institute of Washington.\u00a0</p> <p>She is a graduate of the Front End development program at Iron Yard and\u00a0currently works at <a href=\"http://540.co/\">540.co</a>, where she works to help evangelize APIs and open source software/open data and of course, helps the government #getshitdone (the official motto).</p> <p>Front End Hack Night (FEHN) is a study group where women can come together and help each other learn and understand web development. We welcome devs of all levels and encourage those with more experience to help out those that are just starting. There's always at least one mentor or leader present to help you with best practices or to guide you through if you are stuck with a nasty problem! Laptops</p> <p>In order to maximize your benefits from FEHN, please bring your laptop. Extra computers will not be available at the event. Even if you have never coded before, you will be coding at FEHN!</p> <p>Meetup Agenda Every study group will have the following format:<br/>\u2022 6:30pm - Setup</p> <p>\u2022 6:40 - 6:50pm - Quick introductions</p> <p>\u2022 6:50 - 8:15pm - Code!</p> <p>\u2022 8:15 - 8:30pm - Wrap Up</p> <p>Resources</p> <p>To learn more about us please visit our Github page - <a href=\"http://bit.ly/frontendhacknight\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/frontendhacknight</a></p> <p>\u2022 First Timer's Guide: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fehn-first-timers\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/fehn-first-timers\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/fehn-first-timers</a></a>\u00a0\u2022 HTML Study Guide: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fehn-html-guide\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/fehn-html-guide\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/fehn-html-guide</a></a>\u00a0\u2022 JavaScript Study Guide: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fehn-js-guide\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/fehn-js-guide\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/fehn-js-guide</a></a>\u00a0Building Access</p> <p>Certain building management companies require Meetup hosts to let people in and do not encourage them being contacted.

Please RSVP <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Data-Education-DC/events/229613009/\">here</a>\u00a0for this event.\u00a0</b></p> <p>Have you ever wanted to scale R but are limited due to memory? In this talk Joseph Rickert, blogger, data scientist and R community Ambassador introduces the latest R technology to scale your data analysis.</p> <p>-- TALK OUTLINE --\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Microsoft R Server (formerly Revolution R Enterprise)\u00a0has become the foundation for Microsoft\u2019s use or the R language to tackle big-data machine learning and predictive analytics tasks. At the heart of MRS is the RevoScaleR package that implements a number of parallel external memory algorithms. These \u201cPEMAs\u201d are inherently parallel and designed for distributed computing on large data sets. Unlike standard open source R functions they do not require all of the data to be in memory at one time. I will provide an overview of MRS and show some examples of PEMAs working on data sets too large to be processed by open source R algorithms on my laptop.</p> <p>-- SPEAKER --</p> <p>Joseph Rickert\u00a0is a Program Manager and R Community Ambassador for Microsoft. He came to Microsoft with the rest of Revolution Analytics team where he worked as a data scientist, blog editor and special programs manager. \u00a0He is currently Microsoft\u2019s representative to the R Consortium\u2019s Infrastructure Steering Committee and a member of the organizing committee for useR!2016.\u00a0</p> <p>Previously, Joe held a variety of technical and marketing roles while working for technology startups that spanned multiple industries from local area networks to disk drives, test equipment and health care. Joe entered Franklin &amp; Marshall college on a Classics scholarship and end up a Math major. He also earned an M.A. in Humanities and an M.S. in Statistics from the California State University.

Presentation signups are here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup! We try to start on-time at 6:30. Sometimes we have free food (bonus!). Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",

Looking to build your first web app, learn more about coding, or build on existing skills? Come to our weekly ROR group! We welcome women with all levels of experience. You will be able to ask your fellow coders questions and help each other work through issues. We encourage any advanced ROR devs to come and help others! There's always at least one mentor present to help you with best practices or guide you through if you are stuck with a nasty problem!</p> <p>Looking for something to work on?</p> <p><br/>For those who are new to coding or new to Rails, we recommend Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial. For those who have some experience already but are looking for projects, we recommend Mackenzie Child's 12 in 12 apps. You are always welcome to come and work on something else if you like.</p> <p>Contact policy at buildings that need access</p> <p>Certain building managements requires meetup hosts to let people in and do not encourage them being contacted. Please respect the policy, in case the location requires access to the building contact the group lead if information is provided, or drop a comment on the meetup page. We'll come and get you.

This is quite obvious but less obvious is just how complex many enterprises are in the ways that they produce, acquire, transmit, transform that data from end-to-end. \u00a0The goal of NiFi then is to feed data scientists and their favorite analytic environments with data that is timely, high quality, traceable, and reliable.</p> <p><br/>This talk aims to provide the audience with an understanding of the 'Why' of Apache NiFi, the problem it solves, and how it fits into the big data and data science worlds. \u00a0The talk will start with a brief background on where Apache NiFi comes from for those not familiar with its local roots. It will describe the original use cases and those that exist today and how it relates to systems like Kafka, Storm, Spark and the broader Hadoop ecosystem. \u00a0The talk will conclude with an explanation of where the NiFi community is heading and will include a live demo of the latest NiFi release in action.</p> <p><b>Speaker</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joewitt26\">Joe Witt </a>is a member of the Apache Software Foundation, the Apache NiFi PMC, and is the Director of Engineering leading up development of Hortonworks Dataflow powered by Apache NiFi.</p> <p><br/><b>Projects</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f943c785014b4a14fc8b5f49be74846c66272d35/687474703a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f666c7578636170616369746f722e636f6d2f696d672f6e6966692d6c6f676f2e706e67\" class=\"linkified\">https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f943c785014b4a14fc8b5f49be74846c66272d35/687474703a2f2f73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f666c7578636170616369746f722e636f6d2f696d672f6e6966692d6c6f676f2e706e67</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://nifi.apache.org/\">Apache NiFi\u00a0</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://hortonworks.com/hdf/\">Hortonworks Dataflow</a></p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!
