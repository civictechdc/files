Then, let's get practical and walk through how to launch a web app. For January, a tech founder will share the intersection of her subject matter expertise with tech, discussing how localization (fitting a site or piece of software to a culture, often including language) interacts with design and development. Then, one of our web dev members will show us the simple steps to deploy a web app.</p> <p><b>Terena Bell</b> is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php\">In Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage\">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p> <p>Say the word \"language\" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p><b>Mandy Moore</b> is a Junior Developer at Mobility Labs and a recent graduate of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.\u00a0 In her talk she'll show you how you can share your projects with the world for free by deploying to Heroku using Git.\u00a0 Basic knowledge of Git, a free Heroku account and a small project to deploy will be helpful but not required.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nIf you're considering joining, please read our rules, to determine if this group is right for you:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/</a></p>",

Do you have an idea for a web application or an app, but aren't sure which is the best platform to build it in? Are you a Product Manager that wants to better communicate with engineers on your team? Or do you simply want to learn what the differences are between Python, Ruby,\u00a0HTML,\u00a0CSS, Java, Javascript, and the seemingly endless number of terms you hear when people talk about programming?</p> <p>This meetup will introduce you to many common terms that might otherwise look like alphabet soup when you first start out. We will start from the ground up to explain what each language is useful for, and what makes them different from each other.</p> <p>This event is perfect for beginners trying to decide which coding \"path\" to take. It is also useful for developers who\u00a0to expand their\u00a0high-level understanding of new languages!</p> <p>This talk was an absolute hit when we first presented it in D.C.

We\u00a0present analysis of mental health phenomena in publicly available\u00a0Twitter data, demonstrating how rigorous application of simple natural\u00a0language processing methods can yield insight into specific disorders\u00a0as well as mental health writ large. What's more, we find evidence\u00a0that as-of-yet undiscovered linguistic signals relevant to mental\u00a0health exist in social media. We present a novel method for gathering\u00a0data for a range of mental illnesses quickly and cheaply, then focus\u00a0on analysis of four in particular: post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD), depression, bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder\u00a0(SAD). We also discuss a hackathon we recently hosted, and an in-progress\u00a0shared task using the data used from these\u00a0investigations.\u00a0We intend for these\u00a0proof-of-concept results, experiments, and explorations to inform the\u00a0necessary ethical discussion regarding the balance between the utility\u00a0of such data and the privacy of mental health related information.</p> <p><br/><b>Speaker</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/glencoppersmith\">Glen</a> is an independent consultant addressing a range of data science challenges -- currently working with the leadership of DARPA's XData program, an affiliate of the Data Guild, and as a part-time research scientist\u00a0at the Human Language Technology\u00a0Center of Excellence at Johns Hopkins University. He joined the HLTCOE in 2008 as the first full-time researcher, staying on full time there until the end of 2014.\u00a0He also maintains assistant research scientist positions within two departments at\u00a0Johns Hopkins: Applied Math and Statistics and Electrical and Computer\u00a0Engineering. His graduate work was at Northeastern University, using computational techniques to explore psychology problems (in linguistics, neuroscience, and clinical psychology). His work spans a number of disciplines: computer science,\u00a0graph theory, statistics, natural language processing, machine\u00a0learning, and psychology. He tends to shy away from curated and\u00a0cared-for datasets, instead preferring the wild-west of real world\u00a0data.

BYO-Projects and laptops for a fun, informal way to learn, code and work on projects with other members in the community. From Ruby on Rails to Javascript to CodeAcademy and HTML/CSS, these events are open to all women or those who support women and minorities in tech. Feel free to come early or stay later. These events are held at public coffee shops, so good seats are on a first come first serve basis. Beginners welcome!</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are not coding workshops. No instructors, no agenda, no lesson plan. These events are very informal so ladies will usually bring their own projects or meet people who are working on similar projects to collaborate together. If you're a beginner we recommend some online tutorials like Code Academy or General Assembly Dash. The hope is that you will find ladies who are learning similar coding languages and projects to work with or ask questions.</p> <p>When you arrive, we'll be around the tables/booths in the back. Look for a few signs. If you can't find us, tweet @DCFemTech and we'll do our best to find you.</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are sponsored by @DCfemtech, @WomenWhoCodeDC, @LadiesWhoCode DC, @RailsGirlsDC, @GirlDevelopItDC and @PyLadiesDC. Check out their individual pages for resources and more events throughout the month!</p> <p><img src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif\" /></p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!
