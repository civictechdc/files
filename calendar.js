MrGeo (MapReduce Geo) is a geospatial toolkit designed to provide raster-based geospatial capabilities that can be performed at scale. MrGeo is built upon the Hadoop ecosystem to leverage the storage and processing of 100\u2019s of commodity computers.</p> <p>\u2022 Chris Rasmussen will talk about why the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency started developing code in the open via Github and the wins they're seeing from the collaborative approach.\u00a0</p> <p>Come out at 7pm to grab a drink and bite to eat. We'll kick off introductions and lightning talks at 7:30pm. There will be time after to talk with our speakers and everyone else. Stetsons is a 21 and over venue. If you're not yet 21 but want to attend, message us via meetup and we'll do our best to get you in.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>GeoDC meets on the first Wednesday of the month to learn, network, and talk about the work people are doing with maps, GIS, geodata, and more. Join this meetup group, follow @Geo_DC on Twitter, and join our Google group for updates.</p> <p><br/>Do you have something you'd like to share with the group? Let us know!</p>",

Then, let's get practical and walk through how to launch a web app. For January, a tech founder will share the intersection of her subject matter expertise with tech, discussing how localization (fitting a site or piece of software to a culture, often including language) interacts with design and development. Then, one of our web dev members will show us the simple steps to deploy a web app.</p> <p><b>Terena Bell</b> is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php\">In Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage\">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p> <p>Say the word \"language\" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p><b>Mandy Moore</b> is a Junior Developer at Mobility Labs and a recent graduate of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.\u00a0 In her talk she'll show you how you can share your projects with the world for free by deploying to Heroku using Git.\u00a0 Basic knowledge of Git, a free Heroku account and a small project to deploy will be helpful but not required.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nIf you're considering joining, please read our rules, to determine if this group is right for you:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/</a></p>",

Presentation signups are here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have 5 minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!
