The Bayesian approach is quite flexible, allowing the modeler to explore non-standard model formulations. The resulting uncertainty is characterized by a (multivariate) probability distribution for the unknown model parameters. This talk will also describe the Metropolis algorithm, a surprisingly general recipe for generating a (dependent) Monte Carlo sample from this posterior distribution. The concepts will be demonstrated using simple R code which will be made available for all to try out. Time permitting, the talk will also show how this basic approach can be used for some \"hand crafted\" analyses.</p> <p><b>About the speaker: </b><br/>Dr. David Higdon is a professor in the Social Decision Analytics Laboratory at Virginia Tech University. Previously, he spent 10 years as a scientist or group leader of the Statistical Sciences Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He is an expert in Bayesian statistical modeling of environmental and physical systems, combining physical observations with computer simulation models for prediction and inference. His research interests include space-time modeling; inverse problems in hydrology and imaging; statistical modeling in ecology, environmental science, and biology; multiscale models; parallel processing in posterior exploration; statistical computing; and Monte Carlo and simulation based methods. Dr. Higdon has served on several advisory groups concerned with statistical modeling and uncertainty quantification and co-chaired the NRC Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Validation, Verification, and Uncertainty Quantification. He is a fellow of the American Statistical Association. Dr. Higdon holds a B.A. and M.A. in mathematics from the University of California, San Diego, and a Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Washington.</p>",

Going beyond simple A/B testing, Bandit approaches continuously exploit the knowledge they have learned about user preferences, maximizing value as they learn. As a short postscript, Harlan Harris will talk about Bandit modeling when preference data is incomplete and delayed. Expect to learn about tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation, algorithms for continuous learning and optimization, and how much of a difference they can make in practice.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a06:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:15pm -- Presentations and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>Tonic,\u00a02036 G St NW</i>)</p> <p><b>Abstracts:</b></p> <p>1.</p> <p>At OpBandit, we built a service that renders different versions of news content for rendering on top publishers across six countries.\u00a0 At a high level, whenever a reader requests a page on a publisher's website, our service selects from multiple versions of headlines and photos to deliver the collection of versions that we think a user is most likely to click.\u00a0 This requires decision making on the fly for each request, with hard requirements for speed, reliability, and selection quality.\u00a0 This talk will cover the technical approaches we used (mostly solutions to the multi-armed bandit problem) to make content version selections, as well as the product implications of our choices and the results of each approach.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bamuller\">Brian Muller</a> is the Director of Data Science at <a href=\"http://www.voxmedia.com/\">Vox Media</a>.\u00a0 Previously, he was the CTO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://opbandit.com/\">OpBandit</a> (acquired by Vox), a content optimization tool for online publishers.\u00a0 Prior to founding OpBandit, he was the Lead Data Scientist at LivingSocial.\u00a0 While at LivingSocial, he founded the data science team and oversaw the creation and growth of a big data infrastructure and the teams necessary to support it - all while the customer base grew from thousands to over 70 million users.\u00a0 Before that, he worked as the Web Director for Foreign Policy Magazine under the Washington Post.\u00a0 He as a MS in the Biomedical Sciences, and has spent time in academia working for the Medical University of South Carolina and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine focused on squeezing meaningful information out of vast quantities of genomic data.

This talk will explore options for tackling the problem of bandit-like optimization when feedback is slow and incomplete, such as in direct marketing campaigns where purchases may be delayed weeks or months.

Unfortunately, base R data load and transform processes are slow for larger data sets.</p> <p>To alleviate this problem, the contributors to the data.table package in R have rewritten many data flow tools in C, with dramatic speed gains. Moreover, data.table can often do with one line what base-R users would require a page of code for. This has come at the cost of a rather demanding coding syntax.\u00a0</p> <p>During this talk, I will try to partially demystify data.table by going over a limited basic set of data.table operations, benchmarking against base-R as I go. For even larger data.sets, using R for ETL becomes unwieldly, so, time allowing, I will also attempt to demonstrate a few basic uses of Pentaho's PDI toolset.</p> <p><b>About Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Serban Tanasa is a managing director of Sunstone Science, a new innovative Business Intelligence and Analytics startup in the DC Metro Area.</p> <p>A migrant from the world of academia and international development, he is also serving as the director of analytics and research at CSBS, where he is currently building a BI solution from the ground up.</p> <p>Serban's hard at work bridging the gap between traditional Business Intelligence and the new wave of analytics-heavy methods surrounding Big Data.</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup!

A powerful feature is that it supports multiple sources of tabular data, including data.frames, data.tables, and several dialects of relational database. But data.frames are not databases!

IT professionals continue to struggle capturing, transforming, and analyzing these complex data structures mixed with traditional relational style datasets using conventional MPP and/or Hadoop infrastructures. \u00a0Public cloud infrastructures such as Amazon and Azure provide almost unlimited resources and scalability to handle both structured and semi-structured data (XML, JSON, AVRO) at Petabyte scale. \u00a0These new capabilities coupled with traditional data management access methods such as SQL allow organizations and businesses new opportunities to leverage analytics at an unprecedented scale while greatly simplifying data pipeline architectures and providing an alternative to the \"data lake\".</p> <p><br/>Please join DWDC and Snowflake Computing for a discussion of these topics and a demonstration of this game changing technology. The demonstration will focus on analyzing structured and semistructured together using a commercially available cloud based platform and standards based SQL language to provide insights on large petabytes scale data sets.\u00a0</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup!
