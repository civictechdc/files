In GXT 4.0, the core widgets have been updated to include touch functionality such as draggable borders, tree expand / collapse, LiveGrid scrolling, and long press to hover. In addition, you can add new gesture recognizers such as pinch and rotate to your apps. In this presentation, we\u2019ll look at the ins and outs of JavaScript touch event handling for GWT developers, touch support in GXT 4.0 widgets, how to eliminate the 300ms click delay in mobile browsers, and how to work with GXT\u2019s new gesture recognizers. In addition, we\u2019ll discuss some of the lessons learned by the GXT team while building GXT 4.0 and demo some debugging strategies for GWT apps on touch devices.</p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b></p> <p>David Chandler is the Developer Advocate for GXT with <a href=\"https://www.sencha.com/\">Sencha</a>, Inc.

Regardless of what we\u2019re designing -- a website, an Android app, or a toaster--we all strive to make our designs useful, easy to use, and enjoyable to use. But how exactly do we make something useful, easy to use, and enjoyable? How do we know if the target audience is having a good or bad experience? This class will arm you with the essential tips to find those answers.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About the Instructor:\u00a0</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/a/9/600_441594697.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Jenny is a UX designer with background in UI design, web development, and painting.\u00a0</p> <p>Fascinated with Human-Computer Interaction, how it affects our daily lives, and how interacting with, and building, technology could improve our lives; Jenny's\u00a0passion is\u00a0making software usable, and bridging the gap between clients and users with developers and technology.</p> <p>Jenny is currently consulting\u00a0with agencies, startups and small businesses on awesome digital projects.

DVDC and Max Watson are happy to introduce Time Maps. Time is usually thought of as a continuous flow of events, but we can visualize time as relative to discrete events. By assigning xy coordinates before the event and after the event, respectively, patterns emerge, insights can more easily be drawn, and conclusions easily reached. When do people interact on social media most? What does social activity for different personalities look like? How does rock n' roll compare to yoga? These questions become discernible at a glance using Time Maps.</p> <p>Max Watson is a PhD Physicist, postdoctoral fellow at NIST, and Data Scientist at L-3 Global Communications. Max's work with Time Maps derives from his experience with product development and effectively communicating advanced analytics.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>\u2022 6:30 - Doors open, networking</p> <p>\u2022 7ish - Introductions &amp; Announcements</p> <p>\u2022 7:15 - Presentation</p> <p>\u2022 7:55 - Q&amp;A \u2022 8:20 - Data Drinks (Super Secret Location TBA)</p> <p>SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT</p> <p>This is a slightly shorter presentation than normal, so if you have a 15 minute talk you would like to give, please feel free to contact any of the DVDC organizers.\u00a0</p> <p>In addition, Data Community DC is happy to welcome <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/WomenDataScientistsDC/\">Women Data Scientists DC</a> as its newest Program!\u00a0</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes].

            "description": "<p>For our November Data Science DC, we're thrilled to have to speakers talk about machine learning algorithms and how they can be socially responsible, or not. Mike Williams from Fast Forward Labs in NYC will be talking about how supervised learning algorithms can amplify existing inequality, and Prof. Lisa Singh from Georgetown will present her research on the digital trails we leave on the web. Much of the Big Data revolution is our new ability to analyze extensive, detailed data generated by people and their behavior -- these presentations will provide you with insights into what you can do better to leverage this data in a responsible way.</p> <p>NOTE: The venue for this event is still being confirmed, but we expect to post it momentarily. It'll almost certainly be downtown, near the White House.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a06:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:15pm -- Presentations and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>TBA</i>)</p> <p><b>Presentations:</b></p> <p><i>Mike Williams:</i></p> <p>This talk will use the example of sentiment analysis to show that supervised machine learning has the potential to amplify the voices of the most privileged people in society. A sentiment analysis algorithm is considered \u2018table stakes\u2019 for any serious text analytics platform in social media, finance, or security. As an example of supervised machine learning, I\u2019ll show how these systems are trained. But I'll also show that they have the unavoidable property that they are better at spotting unsubtle expressions of extreme emotion. Such crude expressions are used by a particularly privileged group of authors: men. In this way, brands that depend on sentiment analysis to 'learn what people think' inevitably pay more attention to men. But the problem doesn't stop with sentiment analysis: at every step of any model building process, we make choices that can introduce bias, enhance privilege, or break the law! I'll review these pitfalls, talk about how you can recognise them in your own work, and touch on some new academic work that aims to mitigate these harms.\u00a0</p> <p>Mike Williams is a research engineer at <a href=\"http://www.fastforwardlabs.com/\">Fast Forward Labs</a>, which helps organizations accelerate their data science and machine intelligence capabilities by profiling near future technologies from academia and elsewhere, producing reports on their development and prototypes demonstrating their application.

This talk will present a\u00a0novel information exposure detection framework that generates and analyzes the web footprints users leave across the social web. Our approach uses probabilistic operators, free text attribute extraction, and a population-based inference engine to generate the web footprints.\u00a0Using a web footprint, the framework then quantifies a user\u2019s level of information exposure relative to others and makes suggestions on which attributes to remove or hide.\u00a0 After presenting the framework, I will show an evaluation that quantifies information exposure on\u00a0 public profiles from\u00a0Google+, LinkedIn, FourSquare, and Twitter.\u00a0Finally, the talk will conclude with a brief discussion about data privacy and ethics.</p> <p>Dr. <a href=\"http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~singh/\">Lisa Singh</a> is the Graduate Director and an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University.\u00a0Her research interests are in data science, data mining, and databases.

This happens literally in a Word or Google Doc. That's the 'platform' for content design. Lo-fi, inexpensive and quick testing that mitigates rounds and rounds of UX testing.\u00a0</p> <p>We then conduct content testing with customers and prospects using a variety of methods and tools, which I think the group would find interesting and helpful. The objective? To see what WORDS resonate (and fail) BEFORE UX begins.\u00a0</p> <p>All this happens before we pass anything off to designers and in concert with\u00a0presentations and workshop with designers, product owners and others across the organization to ensure they understand the Content-First approach, and can incorporate humanity into everything they do.\u00a0</p> <p><b>SPEAKERS</b></p> <p><b>Sarah Goelitz<br/></b>UX Content Strategist, Capital One</p> <p><b>Michaela Hackner\u00a0</b><br/>Senior Manager UX Content Strategy, Capital One</p> <p><b>Cory Jurentkuff\u00a0<br/></b>Manager, Content Strategy, Digital Innovation &amp; Design\u00a0<br/>Capital One</p> <p>==================================</p> <p><b><i>Our Sustaining Sponsor</i></b></p> <p><img src=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/138911562/sitecorelogo4meetup.jpg\" /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sitecore.com/\">Sitecore</a>\u00a0is the global leader in customer experience management software that lets marketers own the experience of every customer or prospect that engages with their brand.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup! We'll start close to seven. There may be a couple beers. It's going to be fun! :) Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",
