As though the folks reading our blogs and following our accounts have the same nuanced understanding of a given issue as those working full time on it. This can severely limit your audience. Non-profits can avoid this common pitfall and make content that is compelling to a wider audience by borrowing some basic research methods and formal work processes from the field of advertising account planning. Those methods and work processes will be the focus of this talk.</p> <p>We begin at 6:30 with networking, drinks and appetizers.

Multiple scholarly analyses of the historical record have shown how the climate is already changing and impacting virtually almost all parts of our blue planet, whereas massively parallel General Circulation Model simulations paint a vivid picture of what lies ahead in the coming decades through the end of the century. These simulations derive their basis from various disciplines including physics, chemistry, ecology, statistics, engineering, and even economics. Data Science is the invisible thread that connects these interdisciplinary strands into a unified model. The objective of this presentation is to provide a brief overview of the methods, both statistical and dynamical, used in the speaker's specialization of high-resolution climate simulations. It concludes with a case study drawn from the speaker's recent research.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pracherla9\">Pavan Racherla</a>\u00a0has a Ph.D. in Engineering &amp; Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University (2007), wherein his thesis was on \u201cThe Sensitivity of Ozone and Particulate Matter Concentrations to Climate Change at Various Spatiotemporal Scales.\u201d He worked thereafter as a Postdoctoral and Associate Research Scientist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies [masked]). He is currently \u00a0Principal Researcher at a nonprofit organization called NextClimate.

However, forecasting \u2013 in the sense of providing point predictions of future values \u2013 should be used descriptively and as providing warnings.

In GXT 4.0, the core widgets have been updated to include touch functionality such as draggable borders, tree expand / collapse, LiveGrid scrolling, and long press to hover. In addition, you can add new gesture recognizers such as pinch and rotate to your apps. In this presentation, we\u2019ll look at the ins and outs of JavaScript touch event handling for GWT developers, touch support in GXT 4.0 widgets, how to eliminate the 300ms click delay in mobile browsers, and how to work with GXT\u2019s new gesture recognizers. In addition, we\u2019ll discuss some of the lessons learned by the GXT team while building GXT 4.0 and demo some debugging strategies for GWT apps on touch devices.</p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b></p> <p>David Chandler is the Developer Advocate for GXT with <a href=\"https://www.sencha.com/\">Sencha</a>, Inc.

Regardless of what we\u2019re designing -- a website, an Android app, or a toaster--we all strive to make our designs useful, easy to use, and enjoyable to use. But how exactly do we make something useful, easy to use, and enjoyable? How do we know if the target audience is having a good or bad experience? This class will arm you with the essential tips to find those answers.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About the Instructor:\u00a0</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/a/9/600_441594697.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Jenny is a UX designer with background in UI design, web development, and painting.\u00a0</p> <p>Fascinated with Human-Computer Interaction, how it affects our daily lives, and how interacting with, and building, technology could improve our lives; Jenny's\u00a0passion is\u00a0making software usable, and bridging the gap between clients and users with developers and technology.</p> <p>Jenny is currently consulting\u00a0with agencies, startups and small businesses on awesome digital projects.

This happens literally in a Word or Google Doc. That's the 'platform' for content design. Lo-fi, inexpensive and quick testing that mitigates rounds and rounds of UX testing.\u00a0</p> <p>We then conduct content testing with customers and prospects using a variety of methods and tools, which I think the group would find interesting and helpful. The objective? To see what WORDS resonate (and fail) BEFORE UX begins.\u00a0</p> <p>All this happens before we pass anything off to designers and in concert with\u00a0presentations and workshop with designers, product owners and others across the organization to ensure they understand the Content-First approach, and can incorporate humanity into everything they do.\u00a0</p> <p><b>SPEAKERS</b></p> <p><b>Sarah Goelitz<br/></b>UX Content Strategist, Capital One</p> <p><b>Michaela Hackner\u00a0</b><br/>Senior Manager UX Content Strategy, Capital One</p> <p><b>Cory Jurentkuff\u00a0<br/></b>Manager, Content Strategy, Digital Innovation &amp; Design\u00a0<br/>Capital One</p> <p>==================================</p> <p><b><i>Our Sustaining Sponsor</i></b></p> <p><img src=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/138911562/sitecorelogo4meetup.jpg\" /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sitecore.com/\">Sitecore</a>\u00a0is the global leader in customer experience management software that lets marketers own the experience of every customer or prospect that engages with their brand.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup! We'll start close to seven. There may be a couple beers. It's going to be fun! :) Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",
