Matt Conway will talk about his Data Science for Social Good Fellowship work, where he applied Data Science techniques to properties in Memphis, and Jorge Mejia from UMD will talk about a project that used Natural Language to help indentify restaurants at risk of closure.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\nDo you have a project that uses machine learning to understand your city? Please let us know -- we'd love to publish a roundup of other work in this domain on the DC2 blog!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\n\n\u2022\u00a06:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\n\n\u2022\u00a07:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements, Give-aways</p> <p>\n\n\u2022\u00a07:15pm -- Presentations and Discussion</p> <p>\n\n\u2022\u00a08:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>Tonic,\u00a02036 G St NW</i>)</p> <p>\n\n<b>Talks:</b></p> <p>\n\nIdentifying property distress and abandonment with administrative data</p> <p>\n\n\n<i>Bio</i>: Matthew Wigginton Conway is a recent graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, Department of Geography. This summer, he was fellow in the Data Science for Social Good program at the University of Chicago, where he worked with an interdisciplinary team applying data science to issues of housing distress and abandonment in Memphis, Tennessee. He is now a transport analyst and software developer in Washington, DC.</p> <p>\n\n<i>Abstract</i>: Many American cities are facing issues of housing distress and abandonment as the economy evolves. One of the issues faced by these cities is simply knowing where distressed properties are. This information is generally collected using windshield surveys, driving down every street in the city and noting distressed properties. Since these surveys are expensive, they cannot be performed often. Our team applied a random forest to identify distressed properties based on administrative data that is already collected annually, such as tax assessments and building permits.</p> <p>\n\n\nMore Than Just Words: On Discovering Themes in Online Reviews to Explain Restaurant Closures</p> <p><i>Bio</i>: Jorge Mejia is fourth-year PhD candidate in the Decision, Operations and Information Technologies (DO&amp;IT) Department at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. He holds a BS in Computer Engineering and a MS in Electronic Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology. Jorge's\u00a0research focuses on social contagion -- measuring and managing how information diffusion affects consumer behavior and business outcomes. Please visit a recent profile from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/news/phd-candidate-profile-jorge-mejia\">University of Maryland.</a></p> <p><i>Abstract</i>: In this study, we complement the existing research on online business reviews by proposing a novel use of modern text analysis methods to uncover the semantic structure of online reviews and assess their impact on the survival of merchants in the marketplace. We analyze online reviews from 2005 to 2013 for restaurants in a major metropolitan area in the United States and find that variables capturing semantic structure within review text are important predictors of the survival of restaurants, a relationship that has not been explored in the extant literature. We combined machine learning approaches and econometric modeling to derive predictive models that are significantly better than models that simply include numerical information from reviews such as review valence, volume, word counts and readability.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Sponsors:</b></p> <p>\n\nThis event is sponsored by the\u00a0<a href=\"http://business.gwu.edu/decisionsciences/\">GWU Department of Decision Sciences</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.informit.com/\">Pearson/InformIT</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/12YljkP\">Statistics.com</a>, <a href=\"http://datamininglab.com/\">Elder Research</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://novetta.com/\">Novetta Solutions</a>.

You should feel comfortable asking questions during the talk when you have them.\u00a0</b>Matt delivered a previous version of this talk to San Francisco's Python meetup to rave reviews in January.\u00a0</p> <p>(If you don't know what async is and want to understand a little more before the talk -- here is an async talk from PyCon 2014: <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014/what-is-async-how-does-it-work-and-when-should-i-use-it-by-a-jesse-jiryu-davis\">Slides </a>&amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WV7juNmyE8\">Video</a>.)</p> <p>\n\niStrategyLabs is hosting will also provide food and drink, so you can come hungry!</p> <p>\n\n\nAgenda:</p> <p>\n\n\n\u2022 6:30-7:00pm - Arrive, eat, and catch up\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 7:00-7:15pm - Announcements\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 7:15-8:15pm - Talk, Q&amp;A\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 8:15-8:30pm - Wrap-up\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 8:30pm - Migrate to a social venue nearby</p> <p>\n\nAbout the talk:</p> <p>\n\nWhy should Node.js folks have all the asynchronous web application fun?\u00a0 In this talk you'll learn how to use WebSockets with Python, Flask and gevent to build full-duplex communications into your web apps. We'll live code from a blank file to a completed app that updates vote counters in a web browser via WebSockets without page refreshes. Along the way you'll learn good practices to follow when working with virtualenv and Python application dependencies.\u00a0</p> <p>About Matt:</p> <p>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/makaimc\">Matt Makai</a>\u00a0(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmakai\">@mattmakai</a>) is a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html\">Twilio Developer Evangelist</a>\u00a0and Python web developer based in Washington, D.C.

            "description": "<p>Hack and Tell will be at WeWork Chinatown again in April! (Hooray!) Everyone is looking forward to hearing about *your* cool hack! Presentation signups are here:</p> <p>\n\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\nThe format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have 5 minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\nSee you at the meetup! We'll start close to seven. There may be a couple beers. It's going to be fun! :) Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup! We'll start close to seven. There may be a couple beers. It's going to be fun! :) Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",
