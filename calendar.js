            "description": "<p>Please join us for an exciting talk by Dr. Alexandr \"Sasha\" Draganov about the mathematics behind prediction and mitigation of rare, catastrophic events.\u00a0</p> <p><b>About the Talk</b></p> <p>How do we quantify risk that is associated with a financial instrument?\u00a0Intuitively, risk is clearly connected to the\u00a0probability of a loss.\u00a0 In a simple case, we estimate the volatility; however, the dreadful experience of the recent financial crisis shows that volatility alone does not paint the full picture.\u00a0 The common computation of volatility misses the possibility of rare but catastrophic events. \u00a0</p> <p><br/>One possible reason for this limitation is the overuse of the so-called normal probability distribution.\u00a0 It is called \"normal\" for a reason: indeed, it is the most common way to characterize random variations (such as variations in the value of securities).\u00a0 However, this tool must not be applied indiscriminately.\u00a0 A deeper dive shows that it often fails for large, rare variations, precisely when\u00a0there is a possibility of a failure. \u00a0</p> <p>This concept was popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who christened such events Black Swans.\u00a0 Popular books notwithstanding, there is a real mathematical foundation today to deal with this problem.\u00a0 Applications are common in the insurance industry (Hurricane Katrina) or for construction in the regions, where earthquakes are common.\u00a0</p> <p>We have recently completed a DARPA-funded research program, where we applied these new ideas for engineering applications.\u00a0 Using real data from various sensors, we were able to detect and mitigate outliers in real time.\u00a0 In this presentation, we will review the concept and the science of rare, catastrophic events, and will talk about ways to alleviate their effects.</p> <p><b>Meetup Agenda</b></p> <p><br/>6:30 PM - Networking, Food &amp; Drink</p> <p>7:00 PM - Intro &amp; Talk</p> <p>Join us for more discussion after the event with Data Drinks (location TBD).</p> <p><b>Sponsors for this Event</b></p> <p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.datacommunitydc.org/\">Data Community DC</a> for organizational support, to <a href=\"https://www.contactually.com/\">Contactually</a>\u00a0for space, and to <a href=\"https://www.excella.com/careers\">Excella Consulting</a> for our food and drink.</p> <p><b>About Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Alexandr \u201cSasha\u201d Draganov grew up in the Soviet Union, with a limited access to computers. When you cannot rely on a computer, you have to compensate by honing your math and analytical techniques. Today, Sasha uses these skills to do research and development in multiple fields, including applied mathematics, algorithm development, signal processing, and telecommunications. He authored winning proposals and served as the Principal Investigator for multimillion-dollar research and development programs. Sasha published over 40 papers, and presented at dozens of conferences. He holds five U.S. patents. He has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford and a Masters in Theoretical Physics from Kiev University, Ukraine.</p> <p>Sasha runs two start-up companies: one is performing contract research and development for government and commercial customers, and another is developing an innovative software application for personal finance.</p> <p>Sasha loves books. He got hooked on reading while serving 2 years in the Soviet military in a small town, where a local library was the only source of entertainment. He remembers a jolt from reading first few pages of Swann\u2019s Way by Marcel Proust on the steps to a radar cabin. Proust remains one of favorite authors, as are Leo Tolstoy and Robert Musil.\u00a0 Recently, Sasha published a scholarly article in a refereed journal on the idea of virtue in Tolstoy\u2019s work.\u00a0 Sasha also loves fine art and has visited many major art museums all over the world.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Say you're building a simple website with five pages linked together, and a simple navigation bar at the top. You make some changes to the code and want to know if everything still works. So you open your local version of the webpage and click through each button on the navigation bar to make sure they each still lead to the right destination. Not hard, and it doesn't take long.</p> <p>But now imagine you make some changes to a more complex app--one with 20 pages, a login system, various forms, and content that should look different depending on which type of user you're logged in as. You could come up with a checklist of all the buttons you'd have to manually click on\u2014and forms you\u2019d have to test-submit in various ways\u2014while logged in as various different users, checking to make sure your changes didn\u2019t accidentally blow up an obscure but necessary function of your website. Repeating a long list of tests every time you make a small update to your app would get repetitive and tedious.\u00a0</p> <p>Thankfully, computers love doing repetitive and tedious tasks for us! Automated testing\u2014when we write code to perform tests on other code\u2014helps us as developers to save time, expose poorly written code, confidently expand or update our apps, sleep better at night knowing that bugs are permanently addressed, and even think more critically when we sit down to write an app from scratch.\u00a0</p> <p>In this meetup we'll examine one of the most popular testing frameworks for Rails applications, called RSpec.\u00a0</p> <p>***</p> <p>\n\n\nMeetup Agenda</p> <p>\u2022\u00a06:30pm - Setup and start working</p> <p>\u2022 7pm - Break for quick introductions</p> <p>\u2022 7:15pm - \"Ruby on Rails: Intro to RSpec\"</p> <p>\u2022 8:15 - 8:30pm - Wrap Up</p> <p>\n\n\n***</p> <p>Interested in learning Ruby and Rails with an awesome group of women? Looking to build your first web app, learn more about coding, or build on existing skills? Come to our weekly ROR group! We welcome women with all levels of experience. You will be able to ask your fellow coders questions and help each other work through issues. We encourage any advanced ROR devs to come and help others! There's always at least one mentor present to help you with best practices or guide you through if you are stuck with a nasty problem!</p> <p>Contact policy at buildings that need access</p> <p>Certain building managements requires meetup hosts to let people in and do not encourage them being contacted. Please respect the policy, in case the location requires access to the building contact the group lead if information is provided, or drop a comment on the meetup page. We'll come and get you. Want to be a Ruby on Rails Study Group leader? If you are passionate about learning ROR with fellow awesome women and want to help us, come on out!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes].

One of the current challenges has been to create a new patent search for examiners. The challenge is not only to make patents for the united states available to the examiners, but eventually all of the patent organizations around the world.\u00a0</p> <p>Examiners have a lot of domain knowledge and the way they query the current system must be maintained. It's a little more complicated than boolean queries, and less complicated than natural language search. Rahul will talk about his experience in working on and improving a system built on Java, Scala, Cassandra, Spark, SolR, Dojo, jQuery UI. The goal is for you to understand how large scale organizations deal with changing technology and some business and technology take aways.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Rahul Singh is a technology minded business person and a business minded technologist. As CEO of a company devoted to solving the most difficult problems in streamlining, organizing, and unifying business information, he is responsible for training the team, overseeing and creating technology with the research and development team, and fostering client and service partner relationships.\u00a0</p> <p>Although he\u2019s programmed in over 30 computer languages and has worked with numerous platforms, frameworks, and libraries across all major internet software systems, he likes to spend his time sharpening his skills in information retrieval (search), knowledge management, business information systems, and machine learning to come up with ideas for a smarter, more modern enterprise.</p>",
