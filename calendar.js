It sounds like science fiction, but it is actually the science of Private Information Retrieval (PIR). This talk will introduce Apache Pirk - a new incubating Apache project designed to provide a framework for scalable, distributed PIR. We will discuss the motivation for Apache Pirk, its distributed implementations in platforms such as Spark and Storm, it\u2019s current algorithms, the power of homomorphic encryption, and take a look at the path forward.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p> <p>Ellison Anne Williams is a creator and PMC member of Apache Pirk, a pure mathematician by training, and a practical computer scientist in real life.

The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\nPresentation signups are here:</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p><br/>See you at the meetup, at WeWork Chinatown.
