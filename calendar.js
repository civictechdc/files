I spent a long time in reporting, predictive and financial planning solutions before moving to Watson Analytics when it went live almost two years ago. I spent the first 18 months as a seller and have now moved to the leadership team. A large part of what I do is working with our sellers and clients in the new age of cognitive cloud computing. I work with clients of all sizes who are looking to leverage SaaS self-service data discovery solutions into their analytics portfolio.
