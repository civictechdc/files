Dr. Loh recently wrote a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/insr.12016/abstract\">comprehensive review</a> of the history of Classification and Regression Trees, a fundamental technique in applied statistics, machine learning, and data science, and will present his work for us. This will be a great event whether you're new to decision trees, or whether you want to hear about the back-story and the state of the art!</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a06:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:15pm -- Presentation and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>Tonic,\u00a02036 G St NW</i>)</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>It has been 52 years since the publication of AID (Morgan and Sonquist, 1963), the first regression tree algorithm. Owing to its novelty at the time and to the many questions it left unanswered, the paper was met with mostly criticism and cynicism. As a result, little progress was made until the appearance two decades later of CHAID (Kass, 1980), CART (Breiman et al., 1984), ID3 (Quinlan, 1986), and FACT (Loh and Vanichsetakul, 1988). These second-generation methods brought new ideas that resolved many of the issues of AID, but they also revealed some fundamental computational and statistical problems of their own. Research accelerated over the last two decades, being spurred almost simultaneously by the rapid increase in computing power, the rapid growth in the size and complexity of data sets, and the desire for more flexible statistical techniques. This talk will give a brief critical review of the history of the subject and the current state-of-the-art algorithms.</p> <p><br/><b>Bio:</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~loh/index.html\">Wei-Yin Loh</a> is Professor of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He has been developing algorithms for classification and regression trees for\u00a0 thirty years. \u00a0He is the co-author (with his students) of the FACT, QUEST,\u00a0 CRUISE, and LOTUS algorithms and the author of <a href=\"http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~loh/guide.html\">GUIDE</a>. Versions of his QUEST algorithm are\u00a0implemented in IBM SPSS and Dell Statistica. Dr. Loh is a fellow of the American\u00a0Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and a\u00a0consultant to government and industry. He is a recipient of the Benjamin\u00a0Reynolds Award for teaching, the U.S. Army Wilks Award for statistics research\u00a0and application, and the Outstanding Science Alumni Award from the National\u00a0University of Singapore.

            "description": "<p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p> <p>This talk serves as an extremely basic introduction to retrieving data from Hadoop, with a special focus on HBase (the Hadoop Database). Using Pig, non-developers can gather data from the seemingly unwieldy HBase, freeing them to analyze that data with their tool of choice (e.g., Excel, Python). Note: there\u2019s no getting around coding, but if you can write an Excel formula you can write Pig.\u00a0</p> <p>We will begin with a quick and dirty overview of Hadoop and NoSQL databases, with a specific focus on HBase because its flexible schema presents a challenge to Pig beginners. You will learn how to use some short, very kludgy python in the form of a user defined function (UDF) to get around this problem. By the end of this talk, individuals new to code should feel emboldened to start retrieving data from Hadoop.</p> <p><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Gus Cavanaugh is a recovering business major who once sought recognition as a thought leader without realizing how Orwellian it sounded to lead someone\u2019s thoughts. To that end, he honed his ability to make copies, rush around the office, tie a full windsor knot, and nod his head in a sign of vigorous agreement whenever his seniors sought buy-in around a new strategy of leveraging core competencies. While he has barely risen from his nadir, he no longer views the powerpoint deck as the ultimate expression of business acumen and realizes it can be fun to actually build something rather than just speculate.</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p>6:30 - Food and beverages</p> <p>7:00 - Intro and announcements</p> <p>7:15 - Talk</p> <p>8:30 - Head to Tonic for drinks</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

Armed with less-than-average computer science skills, Justin pursues questions and digs out noteworthy stories from Baltimore's open data portal with the intent of improving the community and bringing science to bear on social issues in cities. America's attachment to personal vehicle ownership means that parking has become just one of a multitude of transportation and quality of life issues that Baltimore in particular and cities in general are facing.</p> <p><br/>For folks coming from Washington, the last <a href=\"http://mta.maryland.gov/schedules/display.php?route=penn_southbound.xls\">Penn Line</a> <a href=\"http://mta.maryland.gov/marc-train\">MARC train</a> for DC leaves Penn Station at 9:15pm.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup! We'll start close to seven. There may be a couple beers. It's going to be fun! :) Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",
