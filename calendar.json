Come to our bi-weekly algorithms meetup!</p> <p>This week we'll have a special talk, here's the summary:</p> <p>Do you suffer from too much geographical data to handle? Ever wanted to round latitude and longitude to an arbitrary level of precision to make them easier to process but didn't know how? Fortunately, a solution is in sight: geohashing is a technique for compressing geo coordinates and simplify working with them. Join me, Mary Griffus, at Women Who Code: Algorithms on October 24th and you, too, will be able to geohash like a pro. We will discuss use cases for geohashing and the math behind how it works, and write a geohashing algorithm as a codealong (Python and Java will be provided for each step).\u00a0</p> <p>Find material from past algorithm meetups <a href=\"https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/algorithms-community/blob/master/algorithms_study_resources.md\">here</a>.</p> <p>Please arrange to get your own food before the meetup today as there won't be any food provided for today.</p> <p><br/>This event is intended to be exclusively open for women; we are trans* friendly.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>See you there!</p>",

Upon graduating from Widener\u00a0University School of Law in Delaware, he went on to work in the non-profit\u00a0sector where he raised almost a million dollars online for various\u00a0charitable causes involving donors and volunteers from over 80 countries. In his\u00a0professional capacity, he has provided digital marketing services to clients as\u00a0diverse as the Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force, Aetna Innovation\u00a0Health, Kaiser Permanente, Silatech, Oxfam, and The Hult Prize. His writing has\u00a0been featured in Entrepreneur.com, Business2Community, and LinkedIn Publisher. In 2016, his work in data science drew recognition when his anti-ISIS dataset became the #1 trending dataset on Kaggle \u2013 the largest online community of data scientists. He gave a keynote address entitled \u201cInnovation Culture: Multiplying Impact Across Sectors\u201d and also lead a plenary session entitled \u201cData Mining 101: How to Use Twitter to Find Terrorists\u201d at the Fall 2016 Business Analytics Form at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. In 2015, his company was appointed to Private Sector Committee along with Goldman Sachs and IBM to the Global Community Engagement Resiliency Fund (GCERF). In December 2014, Khuram and his co-worker won 1st place at the Hedaya Hackathon during the Global CVE Expo where they developed and prototyped a crowdsourcing and social media platform to counter violent extremist messages.\u00a0He is the cofounder of Tekfeuds, an annual event that brings together big brands and passionate technologists to use Oxford-style to debate contemporary tech issues. He serves on the board of Project Katalyst, a non-profit whose mission is to use technology to help displaced and at-risk youth all over the world.</p> <p><b>Sponsors:</b></p> <p>This event is sponsored by the <a href=\"http://business.gwu.edu/programs/specialized-masters/m-s-in-business-analytics/academic-program/\">George Washington Business School MS in Business Analytics Program</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/12YljkP\">Statistics.com</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://datamininglab.com/\">Elder Research</a>, <a href=\"https://www.novetta.com/\">Novetta</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/gov/2016/\">PAWGOV</a>, <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/\">O'Reilly</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.boozallen.com/consulting/strategic-innovation/nextgen-analytics-data-science\">Booz Allen Hamilton</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://engineering.aol.com/\">AOL</a>.\u00a0(Would your organization like to sponsor too?

It sounds like science fiction, but it is actually the science of Private Information Retrieval (PIR). This talk will introduce Apache Pirk - a new incubating Apache project designed to provide a framework for scalable, distributed PIR. We will discuss the motivation for Apache Pirk, its distributed implementations in platforms such as Spark and Storm, it\u2019s current algorithms, the power of homomorphic encryption, and take a look at the path forward.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p> <p>Ellison Anne Williams is a creator and PMC member of Apache Pirk, a pure mathematician by training, and a practical computer scientist in real life.
