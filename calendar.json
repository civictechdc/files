This is fantastic for productivity, accuracy, and a million other reasons- but by building in the same tools we risk uniformity in output. There are endless ways to make something look custom, but one of the best is to simply incorporate illustrative elements- whether they be a hand drawn pattern, icon marker, or classic marginalia.</p> <p>Sometimes it's nice to take a break from the digital screens of our lives and bust out the pen and paper. Join us for an evening of drawing and tracing beautiful maps at this special Maptime.</p> <p>Dylan will go over when illustrative embellishments are appropriate, and some techniques he's found useful for bringing handy work to the digital world. If you have hesitations based on self perceived art skills, please don't let that discourage you! There is still a lot you can do, we promise.</p> <p>Inspiration and some preview activities can be <a href=\"https://github.com/ddai/hand-drawn-maps\">found here</a>.\u00a0Some art supplies will be available including colored pencils, markers, and paper, but please bring your own if you have some or if you'd like to work with a different medium.

As data gets large and complex, more work needs to be done to do the bookkeeping.\u00a0 Apache Accumulo is an implementation of Google\u2019s big table with the focus on large scale and security.\u00a0 Apache Spark is the next generation compute platform. Both Accumulo and Spark can be used on Hadoop file system (HDFS). Both technologies together become a great way to do ETL first, and follow up with analytics using Sparks MLlib or GraphX.</p> <p>The goal of this presentation is to add new tools to the the data scientist toolbox. We will go through the benefits of using Accumulo and Spark as a custom data analytic platform and provide with some simple examples to ease processing.\u00a0 Once you know the basics, you can leverage any of your data analytic skills to build on top of a solid platform.</p> <p>\n\n\nMeetup Agenda</p> <p>\n\n\n\n6:30 - 7:00 \u00a0Food, drinks and meeting new people\u00a0</p> <p><br/>7:00 - 7:15 \u00a0Introduction and announcements\u00a0</p> <p><br/>7:15 - 8:30 \u00a0Presentation and Q&amp;A</p> <p>\n\n\n8:30 \u00a0After-Meetup gathering at <a href=\"http://highlinerxr.com/\">Highline</a>\u00a0Crystal City</p>",

Our guest speaker for September will be trans-Atlantic data journalism rock star, Mark McDonald. Mark\u2019s presentation will focus on the data process in journalism, and how the information age has transformed our abilities in storytelling and reporting. I will also appeal to journalists to utilize the big data tools in their work as much as possible, leading to a better informed public. \u00a0</p> <p><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/4/005/0b5/17a/1264a57.jpg\" /></p> <p><b>Check out our\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.datacommunitydc.org/discounts-and-promotions/\">Benefits for Members</a>!</b></p> <p><b>Hiring?

While working for the BBC his work included coverage, both short and long-form, of international politics, five U.S. Presidential elections, battlefield conflict, diplomacy, the United Nations and its agencies, as well as natural and human tragedies.</p> <p>In the 90s Mark made the intrepid voyage across the Atlantic via jet airplane to hold senior management positions with the BBC\u2019s New York Bureau before transferring to US Public Radio, serving senior positions at WNYC in New York, where he built a stellar reporting team that won the Edward R. Murrow Award and the DuPont Columbia Award for investigative reporting. \u00a0After Mark left New York he became Programming Director WAMU in Washington, DC, in this position he brought podcasting, internet streaming, and digital content management to WAMU, expanding the station\u2019s range and increasing the listing base dramatically.</p> <p>Mark is the founder and CEO of Birkdale Media, a boutique media and public relations firm; Birkdale specializes in media coaching, interview preparation, public relations for individuals and for corporations.</p> <p>Above all else, Mark is a champion for data and data visualization in the newsroom and on the air. \u00a0We conducted an interview with him and were really impressed by the passion he displayed for Data Viz \u2013 full text of the interview below:</p> <p><br/>1) What got you into data visualization and how do you think data visualization has enhanced your profession?\u00a0</p> <p><b>Mark: </b>TV and Video Graphics have become so much more sophisticated in the digital age that they can be designed much more quickly, easily, and contain much more useful information for viewers, helping producers to explain complex stories and issues, and put them into better context than ever before. The internet means blogs, news-sites, etc. can contain way more vital information\u00a0and background than they did before - and many organizations are utilizing data to enhance their story-telling, provide background, history, and further detail.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\n2) You worked for the BBC, how do you think that working for an international news agency affected your views on data?\u00a0</p> <p><b>Mark:\u00a0</b>In my day (80's and 90's) a sophisticated graphic could take days, even weeks to assemble to be inserted into a news report. New technology speeds this process meaning producers can make much better use of graphics on video and on the web.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\n3) How do you see data visualization shaping the future of news media or vice versa how do you see news media shaping the path of data visualization?\u00a0</p> <p><b>Mark:\u00a0</b>It opens up vast new possibilities for journalism. Better analysis, better explanations and details in investigative work (being able to collate and display complex documents, and show how they relate to each other, for instance). The news media in turn can drive the quest for big data using the Freedom of Information legislation on complex stories and issues and making it public utilizing graphics and big data.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\n4) How do we make the news - print, media, digital, etc.- Great Again?\u00a0</p> <p><b>Mark:\u00a0</b>By using our imagination about how to tell stories and raise important issues in a more captivating and compelling way, rather than feeding the public cheap consumer-driven news which is often second or third hand.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\n5) What international news story from the past decade could have had a different outcome if data visualization was better used in covering it?\u00a0</p> <p><b>Mark:\u00a0</b>Resolution from any conflict zone you care to mention - by using big data to report it more accurately (Iraq, for example) thus raising public awareness.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Sponsor Announcements: </b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/e/2/4/600_453868196.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/6/0/0/600_452550208.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/5/f/e/600_452550206.jpeg\" /></p>",

This talk will explore some of the challenges and highlight several of the key cases from the past year. The talk will also discuss strategies attorneys are using to tackle these challenges, as well as where we see this issue heading over the next several years.</p> <p><br/>Speakers include:</p> <p>* Robinson Meyer, The Atlantic, is a technology/climate journalist who covers the emoji beat. \ud83d\udcdd</p> <p>* Gabriella Ziccarelli, Blank Rome, has written on emoji-related\u00a0legal issues. \u2696</p> <p>* Joe Sremack, Boxer Analytics and\u00a0Unicode Consortium member, spends way too much time analyzing emoji modifiers and surrogate pairs. \ud83c\udf9b\u00a0</p> <p>* more TBD!</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\nPresentation signups are here:</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p><br/>See you at the meetup, at WeWork Chinatown. We try to start on-time at 6:30. Sometimes we have free food (bonus!). Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",
