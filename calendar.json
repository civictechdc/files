The idea is to connect people with groups they may not have otherwise known about.</p> <p>There are dozens of active user groups in DC, but we don't often enough come together to make sure we know each other, know which groups are still active, what groups are doing, and where there is room for collaboration.</p> <p>#SuperMeetup16</p>",

You make some changes to the code and want to know if everything still works. So you open your local version of the webpage and click through each button on the navigation bar to make sure they each still lead to the right destination. Not hard, and it doesn't take long.</b></p> <p>But now imagine you make some changes to a more complex app--one with 20 pages, a login system, various forms, and content that should look different depending on which type of user you're logged in as. You could come up with a checklist of all the buttons you'd have to manually click on\u2014and forms you\u2019d have to test-submit in various ways\u2014while logged in as various different users, checking to make sure your changes didn\u2019t accidentally blow up an obscure but necessary function of your website. Repeating a long list of tests every time you make a small update to your app would get repetitive and tedious.\u00a0</p> <p>Thankfully, computers love doing repetitive and tedious tasks for us! Automated testing\u2014when we write code to perform tests on other code\u2014helps us as developers to save time, expose poorly written code, confidently expand or update our apps, sleep better at night knowing that bugs are permanently addressed, and even think more critically when we sit down to write an app from scratch.\u00a0</p> <p>In this meetup we'll examine one of the most popular testing frameworks for Rails applications, called RSpec.\u00a0</p> <p>***</p> <p><br/>Meetup Agenda<br/>\u2022\u00a0<b>6:30pm</b> - Setup and start working</p> <p>\u2022<b> 7pm</b> - Break for quick introductions</p> <p>\u2022 <b>7:15pm - 8:30 pm</b>\u00a0- RSpec presentation</p> <p><b>Contact policy at buildings that need access</b></p> <p>Certain building managements requires meetup hosts to let people in and do not encourage them being contacted.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!
