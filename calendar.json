BYO-Projects and laptops for a fun, informal way to learn, code and work on projects with other members in the community. From Ruby on Rails to Javascript to CodeAcademy and HTML/CSS, these events are open to all women or those who support women and minorities in tech. Feel free to come early or stay later. These events are held at public coffee shops, so good seats are on a first come first serve basis. Beginners welcome!</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are not coding workshops. No instructors, no agenda, no lesson plan. These events are very informal so ladies will usually bring their own projects or meet people who are working on similar projects to collaborate together. If you're a beginner we recommend some online tutorials like Code Academy or General Assembly Dash. The hope is that you will find ladies who are learning similar coding languages and projects to work with or ask questions.</p> <p>When you arrive, we'll be around the tables/booths in the back. Look for a few signs. If you can't find us, tweet @DCFemTech and we'll do our best to find you.</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are sponsored by @DCfemtech, @WomenWhoCodeDC, @LadiesWhoCode DC, @RailsGirlsDC, @GirlDevelopItDC and @PyLadiesDC.

Then, Biplab Pal and Mark Silverman from <a href=\"http://www.treeminer.com/\">Treeminer </a>will talk about an innovative mathematical re-representation of data that allows dramatically faster classification and clustering.

Heuristic methods of optimization can come to the rescue.\u00a0 We will go through algorithms which are modeled off of how genes are passed throughout generations, to methods which were inspired by animal herd movement. The concepts and mathematical basis of Greedy Search, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithm will be emphasized, and time permitting, we will discuss a few tricks, parallelization and the \"No Free Lunch\" Theorem.</p> <p>Brandon Bass is a Senior Consultant at Navigant Energy, working on development of data-driven web and platform applications and expansion of Navigant's proprietary energy market models.

We are pioneering a new approach to these tasks, one based on a novel vertical organization of data.\u00a0 This approach has significant scalability advantages over traditional approaches, and has been implemented in Big Data environments like Hadoop and Storm.\u00a0 We\u2019ll review the mathematical foundations of vertical data mining (vertical \u201calgebra\u201d), and some example classification and auto clustering algorithms that have been implemented using vertical \u201calgebra\u201d.\u00a0 We\u2019ll also review some applications where vertical data organization can provide great benefit.</p> <p><br/>Mark Silverman is the Founder and CEO of Treeminer, Inc., a start-up company tackling the problem of large dataset analytics using Vertical Data Mining techniques.\u00a0Mark has a diverse technology background, including Data Mining and Analytics, IT software and infrastructure, Networking and Security, and Wireless technologies.\u00a0 He co-founded Treeminer with Dr. William Perrizo to bring to market a novel approach to solving the problems of data mining in large datasets.\u00a0 Mark has been intimately involved with the development of the software and algorithms that are at the heart of Vertical Data Mining.\u00a0Mark received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree from Columbia University.</p> <p>Biplab Pal is CTO of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.autopredictivecoding.com/\">Autopredictivecoding LLC</a>\u00a0and Product/Application development manager for Treeminer Inc.

You should feel comfortable asking questions during the talk when you have them.\u00a0</b>Matt delivered a previous version of this talk to San Francisco's Python meetup to rave reviews in January.\u00a0</p> <p>(If you don't know what async is and want to understand a little more before the talk -- here is an async talk from PyCon 2014: <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2014/what-is-async-how-does-it-work-and-when-should-i-use-it-by-a-jesse-jiryu-davis\">Slides </a>&amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WV7juNmyE8\">Video</a>.)</p> <p>\n\niStrategyLabs is hosting will also provide food and drink, so you can come hungry!</p> <p>\n\n\nAgenda:</p> <p>\n\n\n\u2022 6:30-7:00pm - Arrive, eat, and catch up\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 7:00-7:15pm - Announcements\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 7:15-8:15pm - Talk, Q&amp;A\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 8:15-8:30pm - Wrap-up\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\u2022 8:30pm - Migrate to a social venue nearby</p> <p>\n\nAbout the talk:</p> <p>\n\nWhy should Node.js folks have all the asynchronous web application fun?\u00a0 In this talk you'll learn how to use WebSockets with Python, Flask and gevent to build full-duplex communications into your web apps. We'll live code from a blank file to a completed app that updates vote counters in a web browser via WebSockets without page refreshes. Along the way you'll learn good practices to follow when working with virtualenv and Python application dependencies.\u00a0</p> <p>About Matt:</p> <p>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/makaimc\">Matt Makai</a>\u00a0(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmakai\">@mattmakai</a>) is a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html\">Twilio Developer Evangelist</a>\u00a0and Python web developer based in Washington, D.C.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes].

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup! We'll start close to seven. There may be a couple beers. It's going to be fun! :) Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",
