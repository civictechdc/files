The lab infrastructure complies with privacy authorities and maintains security accreditation, allowing DA-E to use operational data to help DHS identify enterprise data analytics architectures and solutions. \u00a0</p> <p><b>James Younger</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Big Data Security</b></p> <p>This talk will focus on the challenges surrounding securing Big Data systems.\u00a0 Hear how traditional security models are adapted to areas of Big Data security, where new approaches are being used and how Big Data itself is being utilized to provide more efficient and effective security operations.</p> <p><b>Shane Cullen</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Big Data Analytics for DHS Components</b></p> <p>DHS S&amp;T is assisting agencies with the development and fielding of advanced analytic systems. This lightning talk will focus on the system architectures and management methodologies that have resulted in successful analytic deployments.</p> <p><b>Aaron Mannes</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Big Data and Terrorism Analytics: Finding Haystacks</b></p> <p>Big data is a powerful tool for counter-terror. The ability to combine and analyze a range of social, cyber, and physical data can be leveraged to find terrorists, predict attacks, and understand their networks. Big data can find broad trends \u2013 the haystacks. But it is not an all-purpose panacea. When big data tools are used to find needles they may find too many, raising a host of legal and privacy concerns.</p> <p><b>Alexandria Phounsavath </b></p> <p><b>Topic: Risk Assessment </b></p> <p>How can DHS use data to respond to risk?\u00a0 The most familiar application of data analytics for risk assessment may be passenger screening at airports.\u00a0 TSA screens approximately 1.8 million passengers a day at 448 airports.\u00a0 Additionally, it prescreens 2 million passengers before they arrive at the airport.\u00a0 This discussion focuses on specific efforts at DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) that will further enhance the use of data for risk-based screening in aviation.</p> <p><b>Chris Featherston</b></p> <p><b>Topic:\u00a0 Alaska/Arctic Situational Awareness Project (A/ASAP) </b></p> <p>DHS has an interest in understanding national infrastructure assets and navigation issues in the Arctic region.\u00a0 The By examining, correlating, and developing analytic predictive tools, it is purposed that DHS can identify trends and datasets that can be tracked, measured and provide a timetable for infrastructure and asset management, movement, or protection.\u00a0 The overall objective for this topic area is developing a predictive analytic capability using observable and historical sensor modeling of climate change in Alaska Arctic areas.</p> <p><b>Linda Vasta</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Wearable Technologies\u2019 Analytics</b></p> <p>In support of one of S&amp;T\u2019s Visionary Goals: \u201cResponder of the Future: Protected, Connected, and Fully Aware\u201d, the Data Analytics Engine is exploring how data generated from sensors in wearable technologies can inform the first responder and emergency management community.\u00a0 A key step in this process is obtaining \u201ccustomer input\u201d from this community.\u00a0 The talk will briefly discuss the methodology and process that will be used to obtain this critical input.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Daniel Marasco</b></p> <p><b>Topic: Smart Cities</b></p> <p>Availability of new digital devices and enhanced connectivity has caused a shift in the way we develop urban environments. \u201cSmart\u201d cities leverage new technologies to solve new and old urban issues. In the past, cities were developed with static infrastructure, rigid in their operation and expansion. Smart cities can use data from vast sensor networks to make decisions, rapidly adapting and optimizing urban infrastructure and systems for ever-changing conditions. Smart city sensors can improve energy efficiency, optimize the pedestrian and vehicle traffic, evaluate principles of urban planning, and provide situational awareness and guidance in emergencies. However, information and communication infrastructure must be intelligent, resilient and adaptable to maximize impact. With proper development, smart cities will be more sustainable, secure, and livable than their more traditional counterparts.</p>",

DVDC and Max Watson are happy to introduce Time Maps.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/3/2/600_443822098.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Time is usually thought of as a continuous flow of events, but we can visualize time as relative to discrete events. By assigning xy coordinates before the event and after the event, respectively, patterns emerge, insights can more easily be drawn, and conclusions easily reached. When do people interact on social media most? What does social activity for different personalities look like? How does rock n' roll compare to yoga? These questions become discernible at a glance using Time Maps.</p> <p><br/>Max Watson is a PhD Physicist, postdoctoral fellow at NIST, and Data Scientist at L-3 Global Communications. Max's work with Time Maps derives from his experience with product development and effectively communicating advanced analytics.</p> <p><b><a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/planitmetro#!/vizhome/MetrobusExplorer/MetrobusExplorerAlpha\">FOLLOW THAT BUS!</a></b></p> <p>Transit agencies are swimming in data.\u00a0 At Metro, we perform surveys, we create schedules, we operate thousands of transit vehicles, and we provide over one million transit trips per day.\u00a0 Our trains, buses and riders together generate tens of millions of data points every day.\u00a0 Metro\u2019s Applied Planning Intelligence group is tasked with helping turn all those ones and zeroes into <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/planitmetro#!/vizhome/MetrobusExplorer/MetrobusExplorerAlpha\">publicly consumable information</a> that result in policy recommendations, and data visualization plays a large part in that effort.</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/e/0/600_443779936.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Michael Eichler is an engineer, urban planner and recovering IT professional who specializes in transforming data into information used to inform operations and planning policy decisions.\u00a0 He is originally from Schenectady NY, raised in Delaware and educated in Washington DC and Berkeley, California.\u00a0 He currently works as Strategic Planning Advisor at Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) in the Office of Planning.</p> <p><br/><b>AGENDA</b>:</p> <p>\u2022 6:30 - Doors open, networking</p> <p>\u2022 7ish - Introductions &amp; Announcements</p> <p>\u2022 7:15 - Time Maps</p> <p>\u2022 7:45 - Follow that Bus!</p> <p><br/>\u2022 8:15 - Q&amp;A\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:30 - Data Drinks (Super Secret Location TBA)</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT</b>\u00a0</p> <p>Data Community DC is happy to welcome <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/WomenDataScientistsDC/\">Women Data Scientists DC</a> as its newest Program!\u00a0</p>",

            "description": "<p>For our November Data Science DC, we're thrilled to have to speakers talk about machine learning algorithms and how they can be socially responsible, or not. Mike Williams from Fast Forward Labs in NYC will be talking about how supervised learning algorithms can amplify existing inequality, and Prof. Lisa Singh from Georgetown will present her research on the digital trails we leave on the web. Much of the Big Data revolution is our new ability to analyze extensive, detailed data generated by people and their behavior -- these presentations will provide you with insights into what you can do better to leverage this data in a responsible way.</p> <p>NOTE: We'll be at Pew Research this month! Thank to them for hosting!</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a06:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:15pm -- Presentations and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>TBA</i>)</p> <p><b>Presentations:</b></p> <p><i>Mike Williams:</i></p> <p>This talk will use the example of sentiment analysis to show that supervised machine learning has the potential to amplify the voices of the most privileged people in society. A sentiment analysis algorithm is considered \u2018table stakes\u2019 for any serious text analytics platform in social media, finance, or security. As an example of supervised machine learning, I\u2019ll show how these systems are trained. But I'll also show that they have the unavoidable property that they are better at spotting unsubtle expressions of extreme emotion. Such crude expressions are used by a particularly privileged group of authors: men. In this way, brands that depend on sentiment analysis to 'learn what people think' inevitably pay more attention to men. But the problem doesn't stop with sentiment analysis: at every step of any model building process, we make choices that can introduce bias, enhance privilege, or break the law! I'll review these pitfalls, talk about how you can recognise them in your own work, and touch on some new academic work that aims to mitigate these harms.\u00a0</p> <p>Mike Williams is a research engineer at <a href=\"http://www.fastforwardlabs.com/\">Fast Forward Labs</a>, which helps organizations accelerate their data science and machine intelligence capabilities by profiling near future technologies from academia and elsewhere, producing reports on their development and prototypes demonstrating their application.

This talk will present a\u00a0novel information exposure detection framework that generates and analyzes the web footprints users leave across the social web. Our approach uses probabilistic operators, free text attribute extraction, and a population-based inference engine to generate the web footprints.\u00a0Using a web footprint, the framework then quantifies a user\u2019s level of information exposure relative to others and makes suggestions on which attributes to remove or hide.\u00a0 After presenting the framework, I will show an evaluation that quantifies information exposure on\u00a0 public profiles from\u00a0Google+, LinkedIn, FourSquare, and Twitter.\u00a0Finally, the talk will conclude with a brief discussion about data privacy and ethics.</p> <p>Dr. <a href=\"http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~singh/\">Lisa Singh</a> is the Graduate Director and an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University.\u00a0Her research interests are in data science, data mining, and databases.
