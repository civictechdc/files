The basis of the method assumes that the if users are known to share preferences for items, those users are more likely to have the same preference for other items. The method has had success in a variety of web-based markets, including Amazon, iTunes, Netflix, and LastFM. This talk covers the basics behind the collaborative filtering algorithm, it\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and ways to augment it to make better recommendation engines.</p> <p><br/><b>Building Successful Data Science Applications</b></p> <p><br/>Data Scientists are under constant pressure to deliver the latest and greatest analytics that save or make organizations loads of money. In this talk, I will draw upon real-life experience to see what it takes to deliver successful data science applications in industry. Using an example from the telecommunications industry, I will show what business leaders need to do to put their data scientists into a position to succeed, and what a data scientist (or team of data scientists) should do to deliver high quality, reliable, and reproducible results - whether they are positive or negative. By walking through the life cycle of an analytics project I present the techniques and processes that foster trust in analytics and pave the way to putting your data science work into production.</p> <p><br/><b>Recognizing Novel Images using Pre-trained Neural Networks</b></p> <p><br/>While there exist many pre-trained neural networks to do image recognition, it is often of interest to classify images that these general networks are not typically trained on. \u00a0Training a neural network from scratch, however, can be quite a finicky, time intensive process. \u00a0However, it is possible to use these pre-trained neural networks as featurizers for novel images, and then to classify them using traditional, out of the box supervised learning methods.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p> <p><b>Patrick Roos</b>\u00a0has two decades of industry and research experience using machine learning, data mining, distributed systems, and modeling to generate knowledge from data and tools to leverage it.

From affecting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat_and_cardiovascular_disease_controversy#Systematic_reviews\">what we choose to eat</a> to looking at <a href=\"https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/new-meta-analysis-confirms-no-association-between-vaccines-and-autism\">vaccines' impact on autism</a>, meta-analyses have an impact in improving our knowledge and understanding, specially when a topic is confusing or has contradictory results and views. It is a means of seeing the forest for the trees, distilling and synthesizing the extant knowledge about a topic.</p> <p>Meta-analyses are mainly seen in the world of biomedical research, so interest is in \"treatments\", namely drugs \u00a0or particular diets or the like. However, \"treatments\" can mean a marketing campaign or a behavioral intervention (like spanking) or a change of a protocol. With that understanding, meta-analysis refers to the synthesis of results from several small but comparable studies to derive overall estimates of treatment effects that typically will be more robust and have higher statistical power.\u00a0</p> <p>Classical meta-analysis involves studies looking at the same treatments to get an overall summary effect of one particular treatment effect. Network meta-analysis can be modeled to utilize indirect comparisons to compare the relative effectiveness of several different treatments of the same condition. In this presentation I will describe both classical and network meta-analysis, as well as the typical problems and biases one has to be aware of in doing meta-analyses. The computations and weighting schemes used in meta-analysis can have direct applications to implement a Divide-and-Conquer strategy so that modeling of large data sets can be done in chunks and the results combined to get valid results for the entire data set. I will describe an example from my experience in fitting competing risks models to a large administrative data set.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p><br/><b>Abhijit Dasgupta</b></p> <p>Dr. Abhijit Dasgupta is a consulting statistician/data scientist in the Washington DC metropolis. He is fascinated by the innovative use of data analytic methods to gain insight and tell substantive stories, using modern methods for modeling, simulation and visualization.</p> <p>A PhD-level biostatistician by training, Dr. Dasgupta currently works to bridge the statistics-machine learning divide, by merging machine learning methods with sound statistical thinking and principles to help enhance our ability to derive intelligence from data. He now has over 50 peer-reviewed research and collaborative papers in areas ranging from bioinformatics, cancer research and operations research to methods for cluster analysis and intelligent robust modeling. He also consults for local startups doing bioengineering, business analytics and bioinformatics. Dr. Dasgupta also helps train companies in using R for their analytics needs, leveraging over 20 years experience using R and Python for data analyses and reporting.</p> <p>Dr. Dasgupta also works to build the local data community, organizing the Statistical Programming DC meet up and serving on the Board of Data Community DC.</p> <p><b>Sponsors:</b></p> <p>This event is sponsored by the <a href=\"http://business.gwu.edu/programs/specialized-masters/m-s-in-business-analytics/academic-program/\">George Washington Business School MS in Business Analytics Program</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/12YljkP\">Statistics.com</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://datamininglab.com/\">Elder Research</a>, <a href=\"https://www.boozallen.com/consulting/strategic-innovation/nextgen-analytics-data-science\">Booz Allen Hamilton</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://engineering.aol.com/\">AOL</a>.\u00a0(Would your organization like to sponsor too?

By providing highest quality tools and services, I inspire to help people and businesses identify opportunities for data analysis, explore their data, and gain insights at the speed of thought.\u00a0(<a href=\"http://www.adilyalcin.me/\">www.adilyalcin.me</a>)</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b>\u00a0Visualization is the natural language for data, and interaction can create the natural dialogue. How can we design better spaces to engage in exploratory data dialogue? How can we avoid fruitless paths, and how can we focus on generating insights, not visualizations? In this talk, I will share examples of what inspires my design thinking, and demonstrate the tool I build on those principles, Keshif (<a href=\"http://www.keshif.me/\">www.keshif.me</a>).</p> <p><b>Fan Du</b></p> <p><b>Bio:\u00a0</b>My research focuses on data visualization and human-computer interaction, especially on analyzing healthcare data and user activity logs.\u00a0I work with Prof. Ben Shneiderman and Dr. Catherine Plaisant as a research assistant.\u00a0My Ph.D. study focuses on designing interactive data visualization tools to augment people\u2019s ability in handling and exploring temporal event sequences. Moving forward, I want to work with real users from different domains to see how my tools could help them solve problems.\u00a0(<a href=\"http://frankdu.org/\">frankdu.org</a>)</p> <p><b>Abstract</b>: The rapidly growing interest in event analytics has resulted in visual techniques for extracting insights from event sequence data that come from medical histories, social media activities, online education patterns, cybersecurity threats, etc. This talk reviews our group\u2019s decade of research on visualizing and exploring temporal event sequences. I introduce EventFlow (<a href=\"http://hcil.umd.edu/eventflow/\">hcil.umd.edu/eventflow</a>) for showing visual summaries of thousands of patient histories represented as time-stamped events and demonstrate how it supports hospital quality control analysts to investigate if the required procedures were carried out. I then describe simplification strategies for sharpening the analytic focus so as to cope with the increase in data volume and pattern variety. Finally, I discuss our recent work on cohort comparison and evidence-based intervention planning.</p> <p>ANNOUNCEMENTS</p> <p>Hiring? Job Seeking? Datable.org</p> <p>Building your brand in tech?

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes].

Every now and then, it makes sense to rally the leaders of tech-related meetups in town and gather for one big mixer. The idea is to connect people with groups they may not have otherwise known about.</p> <p>There are dozens of active user groups in DC, but we don't often enough come together to make sure we know each other, know which groups are still active, what groups are doing, and where there is room for collaboration.</p> <p>#SuperMeetup16</p>",

The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\nPresentation signups are here:</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p><br/>See you at the meetup, at WeWork Chinatown. We try to start on-time at 6:30. Sometimes we have free food (bonus!). Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",
