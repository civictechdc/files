The\u00a0lab infrastructure complies with privacy authorities and maintains security accreditation, allowing DA-E\u00a0to use operational data to help DHS identify enterprise data analytics architectures and solutions. \u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Aaron Mannes</b></p> <p>Topic: Big Data and Terrorism Analytics: Finding Haystacks</p> <p>Big data is a powerful tool for counter-terror. The ability to combine and analyze a range of social, cyber,\u00a0and physical data can be leveraged to find terrorists, predict attacks, and understand their networks. Big\u00a0data can find broad trends \u2013 the haystacks. But it is not an all-purpose panacea. When big data tools are\u00a0used to find needles they may find too many, raising a host of legal and privacy concerns.</p> <p><br/><b>Daniel Marasco</b></p> <p>Topic: Smart Cities</p> <p>Availability of new digital devices and enhanced connectivity has caused a shift in the way we develop\u00a0urban environments. \u201cSmart\u201d cities leverage new technologies to solve new and old urban issues. In the\u00a0past, cities were developed with static infrastructure, rigid in their operation and expansion. Smart cities\u00a0can use data from vast sensor networks to make decisions, rapidly adapting and optimizing urban\u00a0infrastructure and systems for ever-changing conditions. Smart city sensors can improve energy\u00a0efficiency, optimize the pedestrian and vehicle traffic, evaluate principles of urban planning, and provide\u00a0situational awareness and guidance in emergencies. However, information and communication\u00a0infrastructure must be intelligent, resilient and adaptable to maximize impact. With proper\u00a0development, smart cities will be more sustainable, secure, and livable than their more traditional\u00a0counterparts.</p>",

            "description": "<p>For our November Data Science DC, we're thrilled to have to speakers talk about machine learning algorithms and how they can be socially responsible, or not. Mike Williams from Fast Forward Labs in NYC will be talking about how supervised learning algorithms can amplify existing inequality, and Prof. Lisa Singh from Georgetown will present her research on the digital trails we leave on the web. Much of the Big Data revolution is our new ability to analyze extensive, detailed data generated by people and their behavior -- these presentations will provide you with insights into what you can do better to leverage this data in a responsible way.</p> <p>NOTE: We'll be at Pew Research this month! Thank to them for hosting!</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a06:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:15pm -- Presentations and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>TBA</i>)</p> <p><b>Presentations:</b></p> <p><i>Mike Williams:</i></p> <p>This talk will use the example of sentiment analysis to show that supervised machine learning has the potential to amplify the voices of the most privileged people in society. A sentiment analysis algorithm is considered \u2018table stakes\u2019 for any serious text analytics platform in social media, finance, or security. As an example of supervised machine learning, I\u2019ll show how these systems are trained. But I'll also show that they have the unavoidable property that they are better at spotting unsubtle expressions of extreme emotion. Such crude expressions are used by a particularly privileged group of authors: men. In this way, brands that depend on sentiment analysis to 'learn what people think' inevitably pay more attention to men. But the problem doesn't stop with sentiment analysis: at every step of any model building process, we make choices that can introduce bias, enhance privilege, or break the law! I'll review these pitfalls, talk about how you can recognise them in your own work, and touch on some new academic work that aims to mitigate these harms.\u00a0</p> <p>Mike Williams is a research engineer at <a href=\"http://www.fastforwardlabs.com/\">Fast Forward Labs</a>, which helps organizations accelerate their data science and machine intelligence capabilities by profiling near future technologies from academia and elsewhere, producing reports on their development and prototypes demonstrating their application.

This talk will present a\u00a0novel information exposure detection framework that generates and analyzes the web footprints users leave across the social web. Our approach uses probabilistic operators, free text attribute extraction, and a population-based inference engine to generate the web footprints.\u00a0Using a web footprint, the framework then quantifies a user\u2019s level of information exposure relative to others and makes suggestions on which attributes to remove or hide.\u00a0 After presenting the framework, I will show an evaluation that quantifies information exposure on\u00a0 public profiles from\u00a0Google+, LinkedIn, FourSquare, and Twitter.\u00a0Finally, the talk will conclude with a brief discussion about data privacy and ethics.</p> <p>Dr. <a href=\"http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~singh/\">Lisa Singh</a> is the Graduate Director and an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University.\u00a0Her research interests are in data science, data mining, and databases.

This happens literally in a Word or Google Doc. That's the 'platform' for content design. Lo-fi, inexpensive and quick testing that mitigates rounds and rounds of UX testing.\u00a0</p> <p>We then conduct content testing with customers and prospects using a variety of methods and tools, which I think the group would find interesting and helpful. The objective? To see what WORDS resonate (and fail) BEFORE UX begins.\u00a0</p> <p>All this happens before we pass anything off to designers and in concert with\u00a0presentations and workshop with designers, product owners and others across the organization to ensure they understand the Content-First approach, and can incorporate humanity into everything they do.\u00a0</p> <p><b>SPEAKERS</b></p> <p><b>Sarah Goelitz<br/></b>UX Content Strategist, Capital One</p> <p><b>Michaela Hackner\u00a0</b><br/>Senior Manager UX Content Strategy, Capital One</p> <p><b>Cory Jurentkuff\u00a0<br/></b>Manager, Content Strategy, Digital Innovation &amp; Design\u00a0<br/>Capital One</p> <p>==================================</p> <p><b><i>Our Sustaining Sponsor</i></b></p> <p><img src=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/138911562/sitecorelogo4meetup.jpg\" /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sitecore.com/\">Sitecore</a>\u00a0is the global leader in customer experience management software that lets marketers own the experience of every customer or prospect that engages with their brand.
