In addition to Ruby, you will also learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap 3 framework. Attendees will watch the video tutorials and complete exercises during the week. At the meetup, we will review the week's lessons, answer any questions and do additional exercises to deepen our knowledge of web technologies. At the end of the 5 week meetup, we will present the applications we built.</p> <p>Because we are using the \"One Month Rails\" coursework this meetup will require attendees to pay for online access to the video tutorials. This comes to $70 a person (30% discount for Women Who Code members included.)</p> <p>Attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops to meetups so we can go over any code questions you may have.

In addition to Ruby, you will also learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap 3 framework. Attendees will watch the video tutorials and complete exercises during the week. At the meetup, we will review the week's lessons, answer any questions and do additional exercises to deepen our knowledge of web technologies. At the end of the 5 week meetup, we will present the applications we built.</p> <p>Because we are using the \"One Month Rails\" coursework this meetup will require attendees to pay for online access to the video tutorials. This comes to $70 a person (30% discount for Women Who Code members included.)</p> <p>Attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops to meetups so we can go over any code questions you may have.

Competing risk survival analysis identifies contribution of each cause to the length of delay.\u00a0 Bayesian network models show interaction among different causes of delay.\u00a0 This analysis shows that ER delays were mostly related to the hospital operations outside the ER. Expanding ER, increasing staff, or improving operations of ER were less likely to have an impact on delay than interventions that improved hospital occupancy (better discharge, expansion of beds, etc.) or improved laboratory response times.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Presenter Bio:</b> Shervin AhmadBeygi is currently the director of systems redesign in the Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

            "description": "<p>For our November Meetup, we're thrilled to have three speakers on one of the most prominent domains for Data Science innovation -- Marketing. From politics to products, predictive models have been fundamental for a number of years in identifying what to sell, how to sell it, and who to sell it to. Our speakers will dive into the technical details. <b>Rob Mealey</b> from NewBrand will talk about how to incorporate unstructured social media data into models of customer feedback. <b>David Young</b> from MarketShare will overview challenges and best practices for Marketing Mix Modeling, optimizing the allocation of dollars. And <b>Dan Porter</b> from BlueLabs will present persuasion modeling, showing how you can estimate the impact of outreach to individual people. Whether you work on marketing data or not, these talks will provide practical insights into working with the complex, noisy data of real people making real decisions.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a06:30pm -- Networking, Empenadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements, Give-aways</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:15pm -- Presentation and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>Tonic,\u00a02036 G St NW</i>)</p> <p><b>Talks:</b></p> <p><b>Rob Mealey</b> is Senior Technologist for machine learning and data science solutions at <a href=\"http://www.newbrandanalytics.com/\">NewBrand</a>, a social media monitoring and online reputation management tool that transforms online reviews into operational social intelligence.</p> <p><i>Abstract</i><b>:</b> Incorporating unstructured data directly into your feature set can improve predictive power of a model, sometimes significantly. However, there are some inherent challenges in doing so that can confound even the most statistically sophisticated. I'll walk through a couple basic approaches that can be used to do this, techniques to be aware of, and their trade-offs and advantages.</p> <p><br/><b>David\u00a0Young</b> is a VP of Analytics for <a href=\"http://www.marketshare.com/\">MarketShare</a>, the Marketing Mix Modeling vendor ranked highest in the industry by Forester Research in both of their latest 2011 and 2013 industry studies. Previously David\u2019s worked in the areas of Customer Targeting, Choice Modeling, and Market Segmentation.</p> <p><i>Abstract</i>: Based in Time Series Analysis, Marketing Mix Modeling aims to parse out the incremental impacts of all advertising channels and non-media influences on sales, and optimize marketing budgets according to which marginal investments offer the highest returns. \u00a0Technically this offers several challenges since the optimization requires estimates for all medias. \u00a0That requirement implies that correlated variables cannot be excluded and that the magnitudes of individual coefficients are as, or more important, than predictive accuracy. \u00a0 The talk will cover a few of the unique technical challenges encountered in MMM and how they can be addressed, as well as the basic value proposition of the analysis.</p> <p><b>Daniel Porter</b> is a cofounder and head of the Analytics Practice at BlueLabs, a Washington DC based analytics, data and technology company formed by the lead practitioners from the Obama 2012 Analytics Team.\u00a0On the Obama campaign, Daniel was Director of Statistical Modeling, where he and his team developed individual level statistical models that were used throughout the campaign for fundraising, media buying and state strategy.\u00a0</p> <p><i>Abstract</i>: Marketing, political campaigning, and healthcare have one major thing in common: millions of per-person treatment decisions must be selected in order to drive positive outcomes.\u00a0Prior to President Obama's reelection campaign, standard practices for persuading voters\u2014that is, changing their minds\u2014were unscientific and driven by long-standing assumptions and hunches. This mirrors outreach efforts by other companies and organizations, which know that a certain percentage of their marketing efforts will inevitably be wasted on people who are not going to be receptive to it. Daniel will discuss his experience using the results from a large-scale randomized, controlled experiment to target persuadable voters for\u00a0political campaigns, as well as ways these cutting edge statistical modeling techniques can be applied to influencing behavior in realms ranging from health outcomes to customer retention.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Sponsors:</b></p> <p>This event is sponsored by the\u00a0<a href=\"http://business.gwu.edu/decisionsciences/\">GWU Department of Decision Sciences</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.informit.com/\">Pearson/InformIT</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cloudera.com/\">Cloudera</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/12YljkP\">Statistics.com</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://corporate.livingsocial.com/browsealljobs/?deep_link=/jobs/olpfYfwH\">LivingSocial</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://novetta.com/\">Novetta Solutions</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://datamininglab.com/\">Elder Research</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.five9group.com/\">Five 9 Group</a>.</p>",

Then, we'll see how the data in a spreadsheet becomes a map that illustrates an important social topic.</p> <p>First, Catherine Dodge will present on how she made a bracelet out of Adafruit NeoPixel rings. She explains her project with her daughter: <i>\"As a programmer who was getting a bit bored by programming, I resolved that in the New Year I would learn to solder. Wires and hot metal, what's not to like? I headed over to the Adafruit website which is teeming with fun, wearable electronics projects. And made the mistake of promising my six year old daughter I would make her any project she chose, to go with her Halloweeen costume. Deadline established, could I hit it?\u00a0 Follow our journey from Arduino to Amazon to Adafruit as we learned to glue and solder and hack and sketch our way to a light-up bracelet!\u00a0 Bring your laptop if you'd like to get started with the Adafruit development environment, we'll walk through setup.\"</i></p> <p><a href=\"http://shannonvturner.com/\">Shannon Turner</a>\u00a0is a software developer and founder of\u00a0<a href=\"http://hearmecode.com/\">Hear Me Code</a>, offering free, beginner-friendly coding classes for women in the DC area.

This meetup will follow the \"One Month Rails\" video series (<a href=\"https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails\" class=\"linkified\">https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails</a>) which teaches anyone (including beginners) how to create a simple application using Ruby on Rails. In addition to Ruby, you will also learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap 3 framework. Attendees will watch the video tutorials and complete exercises during the week. At the meetup, we will review the week's lessons, answer any questions and do additional exercises to deepen our knowledge of web technologies. At the end of the 5 week meetup, we will present the applications we built.</p> <p>Because we are using the \"One Month Rails\" coursework this meetup will require attendees to pay for online access to the video tutorials. This comes to $70 a person (30% discount for Women Who Code members included.)</p> <p>Attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops to meetups so we can go over any code questions you may have. Dates of this meetup will be: 11/12, 11/19, 12/3, 12/10, 12/17</p>",

In addition to Ruby, you will also learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap 3 framework. Attendees will watch the video tutorials and complete exercises during the week. At the meetup, we will review the week's lessons, answer any questions and do additional exercises to deepen our knowledge of web technologies. At the end of the 5 week meetup, we will present the applications we built.</p> <p>Because we are using the \"One Month Rails\" coursework this meetup will require attendees to pay for online access to the video tutorials. This comes to $70 a person (30% discount for Women Who Code members included.)</p> <p>Attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops to meetups so we can go over any code questions you may have.

Then, let's get practical and walk through how to launch a web app. For January, a tech founder will share the intersection of her subject matter expertise with tech, discussing how localization (fitting a site or piece of software to a culture, often including language) interacts with design and development. Then, one of our web dev members will show us the simple steps to deploy a web app.</p> <p><b>Terena Bell</b> is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php\">In Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage\">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p> <p>Say the word \"language\" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p><b>Mandy Moore</b> is a Junior Developer at Mobility Labs and a recent graduate of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.\u00a0 In her talk she'll show you how you can share your projects with the world for free by deploying to Heroku using Git.\u00a0 Basic knowledge of Git, a free Heroku account and a small project to deploy will be helpful but not required.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nIf you're considering joining, please read our rules, to determine if this group is right for you:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/</a></p>",
