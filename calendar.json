BYO-Projects and laptops for a fun, informal way to learn, code and work on projects with other members in the community. From Ruby on Rails to Javascript to CodeAcademy and HTML/CSS, these events are open to all women or those who support women and minorities in tech. Beginners welcome!</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are not coding workshops. No instructors, no agenda, no lesson plan. These events are very informal so ladies will usually bring their own projects or meet people who are working on similar projects to collaborate together. If you're a beginner we recommend some online tutorials like Code Academy or General Assembly Dash. The hope is that you will find ladies who are learning similar coding languages and projects to work with or ask questions.</p> <p>Finding the building: The Mapbox Garage is at[masked]th St. Rear Entrance. This is important. : ) You can only access our office through the alley behind 14th, not from out front. The best way to get to us is to go to the corner of 14th and R, walk west on R and then north up the alley. You'll see our sign from R St and we're in a blue garage with glass doors.</p> <p>We have bike parking inside!</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are sponsored by @DCfemtech, @WomenWhoCodeDC, @LadiesWhoCode DC, @RailsGirlsDC, @GirlDevelopItDC and @PyLadiesDC. Check out their individual pages for resources and more events throughout the month!</p>",

As though the folks reading our blogs and following our accounts have the same nuanced understanding of a given issue as those working full time on it. This can severely limit your audience. Non-profits can avoid this common pitfall and make content that is compelling to a wider audience by borrowing some basic research methods and formal work processes from the field of advertising account planning. Those methods and work processes will be the focus of this talk.</p> <p>We begin at 6:30 with networking, drinks and appetizers.

Multiple scholarly analyses of the historical record have shown how the climate is already changing and impacting virtually almost all parts of our blue planet, whereas massively parallel General Circulation Model simulations paint a vivid picture of what lies ahead in the coming decades through the end of the century. These simulations derive their basis from various disciplines including physics, chemistry, ecology, statistics, engineering, and even economics. Data Science is the invisible thread that connects these interdisciplinary strands into a unified model. The objective of this presentation is to provide a brief overview of the methods, both statistical and dynamical, used in the speaker's specialization of high-resolution climate simulations. It concludes with a case study drawn from the speaker's recent research.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pracherla9\">Pavan Racherla</a>\u00a0has a Ph.D. in Engineering &amp; Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University (2007), wherein his thesis was on \u201cThe Sensitivity of Ozone and Particulate Matter Concentrations to Climate Change at Various Spatiotemporal Scales.\u201d He worked thereafter as a Postdoctoral and Associate Research Scientist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies [masked]). He is currently \u00a0Principal Researcher at a nonprofit organization called NextClimate.

If you're interested in working on something to improve your skills or interested in helping others on a regular basis, you should come. \u00a0There's something useful in it for all levels of Ruby on Rails users.</p> <p>If you haven't looked through this quiz, already, you should do so before attending:</p> <p>Note: Potential mentees with the highest skill level will be matched with mentors who have the highest skill level. Which means that potential mentors with the best skill set will get the more advanced mentees.

Long-time DSDC attendee Lee De Cola will be showing how to think about, analyze, and forecast important world-wide metrics that have been collected for over 50 years. Expect to learn about rigorous ways to analyze temporal data. And maybe there'll be baseball puns.</p> <p>* Anybody want to talk about post-Moneyball sports analytics sometime? Get in touch!</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a06:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>\u2022\u00a07:15pm -- Presentations and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>Tonic,\u00a02036 G St NW</i>)</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>This presentation will use statistical and visualization features of R to explore yearly time series that characterize key global changes since 1950, a period sometimes called the Great Acceleration. Linear regression supplemented with autocorrelation diagnostics can provide most of the key descriptive information about these data, while nonlinear estimation and exponential smoothing can be used to provide forecasts. However, forecasting \u2013 in the sense of providing point predictions of future values \u2013 should be used descriptively and as providing warnings. Widespread understanding of these data is of surpassing importance to the future welfare of life on Earth.</p> <p>Participants who would like to follow along are welcome to bring computers loaded with R and to download <i>in advance</i>\u00a0(WiFi will not be available) the data used for this presentation at\u00a0<a href=\"http://ldecola.net/projects/global/\">ldecola.net/projects/global/</a> .\u00a0</p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://ldecola.net/\">Lee De Cola</a> runs\u00a0<b>DATA to Insight</b>\u00a0a data visualization consulting and training enterprise.

In GXT 4.0, the core widgets have been updated to include touch functionality such as draggable borders, tree expand / collapse, LiveGrid scrolling, and long press to hover. In addition, you can add new gesture recognizers such as pinch and rotate to your apps. In this presentation, we\u2019ll look at the ins and outs of JavaScript touch event handling for GWT developers, touch support in GXT 4.0 widgets, how to eliminate the 300ms click delay in mobile browsers, and how to work with GXT\u2019s new gesture recognizers. In addition, we\u2019ll discuss some of the lessons learned by the GXT team while building GXT 4.0 and demo some debugging strategies for GWT apps on touch devices.</p> <p><b>Speaker Bio:</b></p> <p>David Chandler is the Developer Advocate for GXT with <a href=\"https://www.sencha.com/\">Sencha</a>, Inc.

You are always welcome to come and work on something else if you like.</p> <p>Contact policy at buildings that need access</p> <p>Certain building managements requires meetup hosts to let people in and do not encourage them being contacted.

This happens literally in a Word or Google Doc. That's the 'platform' for content design. Lo-fi, inexpensive and quick testing that mitigates rounds and rounds of UX testing.\u00a0</p> <p>We then conduct content testing with customers and prospects using a variety of methods and tools, which I think the group would find interesting and helpful. The objective? To see what WORDS resonate (and fail) BEFORE UX begins.\u00a0</p> <p>All this happens before we pass anything off to designers and in concert with\u00a0presentations and workshop with designers, product owners and others across the organization to ensure they understand the Content-First approach, and can incorporate humanity into everything they do.\u00a0</p> <p><b>SPEAKERS</b></p> <p><b>Sarah Goelitz<br/></b>UX Content Strategist, Capital One</p> <p><b>Michaela Hackner\u00a0</b><br/>Senior Manager UX Content Strategy, Capital One</p> <p><b>Cory Jurentkuff\u00a0<br/></b>Manager, Content Strategy, Digital Innovation &amp; Design\u00a0<br/>Capital One</p> <p>==================================</p> <p><b><i>Our Sustaining Sponsor</i></b></p> <p><img src=\"https://cdn.evbuc.com/eventlogos/138911562/sitecorelogo4meetup.jpg\" /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sitecore.com/\">Sitecore</a>\u00a0is the global leader in customer experience management software that lets marketers own the experience of every customer or prospect that engages with their brand.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup!
