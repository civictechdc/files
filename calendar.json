This talk will introduce Apache Pirk - a new incubating Apache project designed to provide a framework for scalable, distributed PIR.

The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\nPresentation signups are here:</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p><br/>See you at the meetup, at WeWork Chinatown.
