Emojis present difficulties for attorneys because they can't be identified via keyword searches, and producing the rendered images is both technically challenging with existing software but also highly subjective due to the device-specific emojis used. This talk will explore some of the challenges and highlight several of the key cases from the past year. The talk will also discuss strategies attorneys are using to tackle these challenges, as well as where we see this issue heading over the next several years.</p> <p><br/>Speakers include:</p> <p>* Robinson Meyer, The Atlantic, is a technology/climate journalist who covers the emoji beat. \ud83d\udcdd</p> <p>* Gabriella Ziccarelli, Blank Rome, has written on emoji-related\u00a0legal issues. \u2696</p> <p>* Joe Sremack, Boxer Analytics and\u00a0Unicode Consortium member, spends way too much time analyzing emoji modifiers and surrogate pairs. \ud83c\udf9b\u00a0</p> <p>UPDATE: \ud83c\udf7b + \ud83c\udf4b-ade + perhaps emoji themed snacks will be in the house!</p> <p>Schedule:</p> <p>\u200b6:30 - Drinks and Networking</p> <p><br/>7:00 - DC Legal Hackers Intro and Announcements</p> <p>7:10 - Emoji Intro (Robinson Meyer)\u00a0</p> <p>7:15 - Presentation (Gabriella Ziccarelli)\u00a0</p> <p>7:30 - Presentation (Joe Sremack)</p> <p>7:45-8:30 - Panel and Discussion (moderated by Robinson Meyer)</p> <p>\u200b8:45 Fin/Clean Up\u200b</p>",

This October, we're looking for presenters, speakers, and hackers for anything related to human language, whether text, audio, videos of sign language, etc... show us what you\u2019ve got! (remember: no startup pitches, dull work projects, or deckware). The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\n\nPresentation signups are below:<br/><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\nNeed an idea? Here are some talks we'd like to see at H&amp;&amp;T NLP:</p> <p>+ Political twitter bots, bonus points if they pass the Turing test and fight w/real people!</p> <p>+ the weirdest take on a Turing test that you can come up with</p> <p>+ Haiku!</p> <p>+ Automated assistant hacks, or how I got Cortana to break up with me</p> <p><br/>+ Pen-testing (\"real\" hacking!) with deep learning NLP+ Linguistic analysis of everyone's favorite anti-blog gawker</p> <p>+ Voice activation hacks, like getting Alexa to order a pizza when my dog barks or find the nearest polling place</p> <p>+ generating text based on your own email history (can you simulate yourself? your friends?)</p> <p>+ unsupervised email classification (separate into personal, work, whatever)</p> <p>+ recruit-bot: a bot that corresponds with recruiters for arbitrarily long exchanges (Q-learning on real people?)<br/>+ multi-scale generative text (character + word??? + more?)</p> <p>+ sentiment analysis for your work emails. Maybe don't read some of them right away.</p> <p><br/>+ baby names, learned from pictures of other people's babies and their names</p> <p>+ generate hack and tell ideas?!</p> <p>Does it have to be related to human language? No, but if the speaking slots fill up, we will try to give priority to NLP this month.\u00a0</p> <p>See you at the meetup, at WeWork Chinatown. This month we are starting at 6:30 with pizza and the talks will begin at 7:00.\u00a0 DC NLPers, be a little earlier than usual, late arrivals are disruptive.\u00a0 Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",

We have been performing research with the Laboratory for Physical Sciences on how to apply machine learning to detect malware, and to do so with minimal domain knowledge about binaries and how they work. I\u2019ll be giving an overview about the problem, why its difficult \u2013 especially compared to current ML tasks, and an overview of our current and completed research toward that goal.</p> <p><br/><b>How to Build a Malware Classifier [That Doesn't Suck on Real-world Data] - John Seymour</b></p> <p><br/>Machine learning is the latest trend in malware classification. It's easy enough that now everyone can spin up a malware crawler, extract some features from the files, build some machine learning models, and publish their research in a reputable journal. However, many of these models have issues with overfitting: they have significant accuracy reductions on real-world data. We'll give a full introduction on using machine learning to classify malware, including the features that are currently used, which models seem to work best, and what datasets exist for this purpose. We'll also demonstrate that even the best public malware classifiers overfit to their original training sets. We'll end the talk with forays into avoiding this issue, for creating malware classifiers that don't suck on real-world data.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.edwardraff.com\">Edward Raff</a> is a Computer Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton, specializing in Machine Learning problems and solutions. As the author of the JSAT library, Edward has extensive experience implementing all manner of algorithms. In particular, he has worked on problems involving bioinformatics, signal classification, sentiment analysis, real time object tracking, and change detection. He currently works at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences researching new methods of applying deep learning to cyber security, and in particular malware classification and analysis. Edward holds a Bachelor's and Master's degree from Purdue University, and is working on a Ph.D. at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

He researches the intersection of machine learning and InfoSec in both roles. He's mostly interested in avoiding and helping others avoid some of the major pitfalls in machine learning, especially in dataset preparation (seriously, do people still use malware datasets from 1998?) He has spoken at BlackHat USA, DEFCON, BSidesLV, and aims to add SecTor to the list in the near future.

You can access it on <a href=\"https://github.com/EdwardRaff/JSAT\">Github</a>. It is a Java library for machine learning, built out of my frustration in using Weka. It aims to provide a more efficient and easier to use API, as well as numerous algorithms. Many of the algorithms in JSAT are independent implementations of common tools (such as linear SVMs, Lasso, and t-SNE) and others are more niche or rarely available methods (such as Kernel k-means and AMM).</p> <p><br/>John has released two security related projects on Github.</p> <p>label-virusshare: A project to label the VirusShare malware corpus using VirusTotal's public API.

Come to our bi-weekly algorithms meetup!</p> <p>This week we'll have a special talk, here's the summary:</p> <p>Do you suffer from too much geographical data to handle? Ever wanted to round latitude and longitude to an arbitrary level of precision to make them easier to process but didn't know how? Fortunately, a solution is in sight: geohashing is a technique for compressing geo coordinates and simplify working with them. Join me, Mary Griffus, at Women Who Code: Algorithms on October 24th and you, too, will be able to geohash like a pro. We will discuss use cases for geohashing and the math behind how it works, and write a geohashing algorithm as a codealong (Python and Java will be provided for each step).\u00a0</p> <p>Find material from past algorithm meetups <a href=\"https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/algorithms-community/blob/master/algorithms_study_resources.md\">here</a>.</p> <p>Please arrange to get your own food before the meetup today as there won't be any food provided for today.</p> <p><br/>This event is intended to be exclusively open for women; we are trans* friendly.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>See you there!</p>",
