He will also explain in detail how YARN and Spark run on Mesos and the Mesosphere DCOS, sharing resources amongst each other as well as with other workloads on the same cluster. He will also explain the uniqueness of the Mesos two-level scheduler, how it differs from YARN\u2019s monolithic scheduler and how a modern datacenter can deploy diverse workloads (big data, batch, and long-running services) on a single Mesos or Mesosphere DCOS cluster, collaboratively sharing cluster resources.</p> <p><b>Fully Fault tolerant Streaming Workflows at Scale using Apache Mesos &amp; Spark Streaming<br/></b></p> <p>Spark streaming is one of the most powerful platforms on which to do computation or analytics over real time streaming data. Since the data is streaming in real time, you need a fault tolerant environment to get accurate results without losing any data. This talk will give you insight into how Mesos helps you to create a high availability cluster that can scale and run almost completely fault-tolerant spark streaming applications.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/Benjamin/Hindman\">Benjamin Hindman </a></b>is a Founder and Chief Architect at Mesosphere, where he leads the core engineering team for the Mesosphere Data Center Operating System (DCOS).

In the meantime, a quiet \"evolution\" is occurring, as new digital tools are being integrated into traditional practice settings at a rapid pace. Inside forward-looking law firms and corporate legal departments, lawyers are creating technology-based solutions to increase the effectiveness of legal services. These lawyers are maintaining the highest quality of services while using technologies as a multiplier to drive down client costs.\u00a0</p> <p>This important day-and-a-half conference, sponsored with the ABA Journal, examines how legal technologies are being adopted in many practice areas including litigation, transactional work, compliance, and intellectual property. Each panel's presenters will demonstrate how a new technology they have developed supports improved service delivery. Attendees will have the opportunity to learn how law firms and legal departments are using technology-based tools to address client needs and explore how these approaches enhance the effectiveness of law practice.\u00a0</p> <p>The conference opens with the Iron Tech Lawyer competition on April 22nd from 1:15-3:30 and continues through April 23rd, with panels on technologies in litigation, digital tools in contract management, due diligence, and intellectual property, cross-practice technologies, legal technology careers, and access to justice and open government.\u00a0</p> <p>REGISTRATION = $45 for members of DC Legal Hackers.\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.law.georgetown.edu/continuing-legal-education/programs/academic-conferences/Legal-Tech.cfm\">YOU MUST REGISTER HERE.\u00a0</a></p>",
