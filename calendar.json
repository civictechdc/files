Presentation signups are here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have 5 minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like 3d-printing aluminum parts]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

Conceived by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman from Stanford, the Lasso performs dimension reduction and variable selection, making it well suited for the high dimensionality of today's datasets. In this talk, Jared will go over some of the math behind the Lasso and discuss some recent advancements in performing statistical inference on Lasso-fitted models. He will also show the R code behind the results.

Landmark combines beautiful photos with a strong crowdsourcing community who are passionate about their city and the architecture around them, all to provide directions in a different way.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Karl Phillips will show his work mapping historical changes in cities around the country and demo how he's using <a href=\"http://mapstory.org/\">MapStory</a> to crowdsource this work and release the data openly.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonnordling\">Jon Nordling</a> will show off the <a href=\"http://geoodk.com/\">Geographical Open Data Kit</a>, a mobile data collection and storing platform for geo-referenced information that's fully open source.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Trevor Gerhardt will demo &lt;a&gt;CarFreeAtoZ&lt;/a&gt;, a commute planner <a href=\"http://conveyal.com\">Conveyal</a> has been building for Arlington under their <a href=\"http://mobilitylab.org/tech/transit-tech-initiative/\">Transit Tech Initiative</a>, and will talk about using &lt;a&gt;OpenTripPlanner's&lt;/a&gt; journey profiler and using public census data to analyze accessibility in a region.</p> <p><br/>Come out at 7pm to grab a drink and bite to eat.

Join us for an evening of drawing and tracing beautiful maps at this special Maptime.</p> <p>Inspiration and activities here: <a href=\"https://github.com/ddai/hand-drawn-maps\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/ddai/hand-drawn-maps</a> Don't forget to bring your art supplies: sharpies, markers, crayons, highlighters, etc!</p> <p>**</p> <p>Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.</p> <p>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.</p> <p>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?</p> <p>For more information about Maptime, visit maptime.io. Also, follow us on twitter at @MaptimeDC.</p>",
