DVDC is happy to introduce Nathaniel Pearlman and a discussion of his career from software to data visualization. Nathaniel is the founder/CEO one of the nation's most successful political software companies. After his software company, Nathaniel started\u00a0<a href=\"http://graphicacy.com/\">Graphicacy</a>, a creative analytic design agency, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.timeplots.com/\">Timeplots</a>, an online storefront for\u00a0information graphic products.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/3/5/5/600_446677717.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Nathaniel will discuss lessons learned from\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.timeplots.com/\">Timeplots</a>\u00a0where he and a small team created award-winning, political themed information design posters. He'll share examples of his posters and go into how they were built, lessons learned in the process of building them, and what he might do differently now reflecting back on the work.</p> <p>Case studies to be explored include:\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.timeplots.com/collections/catalog/products/a-visual-history-of-the-us-house-and-supreme-court-bundle\">A Visual History of the US House of Representatives</a></p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.timeplots.com/collections/catalog/products/a-visual-history-of-the-united-states-senate\">A Visual History of the US Senate</a></p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.timeplots.com/collections/catalog/products/a-history-of-the-us-presidency\">A Visual History of the American Presidency\u00a0</a></p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.timeplots.com/collections/catalog/products/a-visual-history-of-the-supreme-court-of-the-united-states\">A Visual History of the US Supreme Court</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55b2b793e4b0a06c6deb4ac5/t/55d8cb80e4b030f73b356529/1450104792939/?format=1000w\" class=\"linkified\">http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55b2b793e4b0a06c6deb4ac5/t/55d8cb80e4b030f73b356529/1450104792939/?format=1000w</a></p> <p>Last year\u00a0Graphicacy held its\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.majorleaguedatachallenge.com/\">2015 Major League Data Challenge</a>, a visual design contest, and DVDC is happy to announce with Graphicacy this year's 2016 Super Tuesday Data Challenge.

Nathaniel majored in computer science at Yale and he finished all but his dissertation in MIT\u2019s political science doctoral program. Outside of academics, Nathaniel is an experienced entrepreneur. He founded NGP Software, Inc. in 1997 (now NGP VAN, Inc.) to join his interests in politics and technology and grew that company into the market leader in fundraising and compliance software for progressive political campaigns. Nathaniel served as Chief Technology Officer for the Hillary Clinton for President campaign in 2007-8. In 2009, Nathaniel founded the information graphic products company Timeplots and reserved the name Graphicacy for information graphics consulting and services. Together, Timeplots and Graphicacy are dedicated to making the visual display of information more comprehensible and aesthetic.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>AGENDA</b></p> <p>\u2022 6:30 - Doors open, networking</p> <p>\u2022 7ish - Introductions &amp; Announcements</p> <p>\u2022 7:15 - Visualizing Our Branches of Government</p> <p>\u2022 8:00 - Q&amp;A</p> <p><br/>\u2022 8:20 - Data Challenge Details\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a08:40 - Data Drinks</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>ANNOUNCEMENTS</b></p> <p>Check out the <a href=\"http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=75fc125999b198f97fe860a8d&amp;id=6e8db1780b&amp;e=263865b99d\">Data Community DC Newsletter</a>!</p> <p>Are\u00a0you or your company hiring?\u00a0<a href=\"https://datacommunitydc.wufoo.com/forms/dc2-job-ad-submission/\">Get in touch!</a></p> <p><br/><b>This Week's Events</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/DC-NLP/events/228357131/\">DC Natural Language Processing</a>\u00a0invites you to their monthly meetup with guest speaker Dr. Boyan Onyshkevich from DARPA's Information Innovation Office.\u00a0On Tuesday, join\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Action-Design-DC/events/225293842/\">\u2022\u00a0Action Design DC</a>\u00a0for a presentation by Opower, a customer engagement platform \u00a0with an energy conservation goal.\u00a0</p> <p>On Wednesday, DC2 is holding three events:</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Data-Education-DC/events/228116564/\">Data Education DC</a>\u00a0hosts an introduction to survival analysis, including practical applications and an opportunity to build interactive survival models using R.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Data-Wranglers-DC/events/222987192/\">\u2022\u00a0Data Wranglers DC</a>\u00a0offers a demonstration of advanced, context-based\u00a0search tools with the capacity to search multiple websites and databases such as data.gov.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/dcnightowls/events/228406886/\">DC2 Digital Nomads</a>\u00a0hosts their monthly Nightowl Productivity event.

Presentation signups are here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup! We try to start on-time at 6:30. Sometimes we have free food (bonus!). Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

One of the current challenges has been to create a new patent search for examiners. The challenge is not only to make patents for the united states available to the examiners, but eventually all of the patent organizations around the world.\u00a0</p> <p>Examiners have a lot of domain knowledge and the way they query the current system must be maintained. It's a little more complicated than boolean queries, and less complicated than natural language search. Rahul will talk about his experience in working on and improving a system built on Java, Scala, Cassandra, Spark, SolR, Dojo, jQuery UI. The goal is for you to understand how large scale organizations deal with changing technology and some business and technology take aways.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Rahul Singh is a technology minded business person and a business minded technologist.

Presentation signups are here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup! We try to start on-time at 6:30. Sometimes we have free food (bonus!). Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",
