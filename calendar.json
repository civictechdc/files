In addition to Ruby, you will also learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap 3 framework. It's perfect for complete beginners to coding or people who are interested in learning Rails development!</p> <p><br/>This meetup is \"flipped classroom\" style - attendees will watch the video tutorials and complete exercises during the week, and at the meetup we will review the week's lessons, answer any questions and do additional exercises to deepen our knowledge of web technologies. At the end of the 5 week meetup, we will show the applications we have built!</p> <p>Because we are using the \"One Month Rails\" coursework this meetup will require attendees to pay for online access to the video tutorials. This comes to $70 a person (30% discount for Women Who Code members included.) We will give out the promo code during the first meetup and set up our environments so that everyone is ready to go when they leave the event.</p> <p>Attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops to meetups so we can go over any code questions you may have.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Schedule</b>:</p> <p>Week 1 (11/12-) Sign up for OMR, Github and Nitrous. Brainstorm Course Expectations and Ideas</p> <p>Week 2 (11/19)- Review Week 1 and go over challenges with first week videos.</p> <p>Week 3 (TBD)- It will be either held on 12/2 or 12/4 due to the big holiday event for the tech community \"Tech the Halls\". \u00a0During this session it will be a review of Week 2 and challenges of second week videos</p> <p>Week 4 (12/10)- Review of Week 3 and the challenges of week 3 videos\u00a0</p> <p>Week 5 (12/17)- Last meeting before the holiday during this session we will do a review on Week 4 and challenges of Week 4 videos as well as discuss ideas for continuing meetup in January of 2015</p> <p><i>*Everything is subject to change base on the needs of everyone within the group.</i></p> <p>Please, please modify your RSVPs if you cannot make it for all 5 meet ups to allow those on the wait list to RSVP.

BYO-Projects and laptops for a fun, informal way to learn, code and work on projects with other members in the community. From Ruby on Rails to Javascript to CodeAcademy and HTML/CSS, these events are open to all women or those who support women and minorities in tech. Feel free to come early or stay later. These events are held at public coffee shops, so good seats are on a first come first serve basis. Beginners welcome!</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are not coding workshops. No instructors, no agenda, no lesson plan. These events are very informal so ladies will usually bring their own projects or meet people who are working on similar projects to collaborate together. If you're a beginner we recommend some online tutorials like Code Academy or General Assembly Dash. The hope is that you will find ladies who are learning similar coding languages and projects to work with or ask questions.</p> <p>When you arrive, we'll be around the tables/booths in the back. Look for a few signs. If you can't find us, tweet @DCFemTech and we'll do our best to find you.</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are sponsored by @DCfemtech, @WomenWhoCodeDC, @LadiesWhoCode DC, @RailsGirlsDC, @GirlDevelopItDC and @PyLadiesDC.

Image reconstruction in units of signal to noise (SNR): This would be me taking a more statistical view of how we reconstruct images such that at the end we know what the signal to noise is in each pixel.</p> <p>3. The extension of the SNR reconstruction to region of interest analysis in MRI images: pixels in the image are not entirely independent, what happens to ROI analysis? Extension to flow measuremens, how do we measure flow with MRI and how do we assign a confidence interval on such flow measurements.<br/><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.25194/abstract\" class=\"linkified\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.25194/abstract</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.jcmr-online.com/content/16/1/46\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.jcmr-online.com/content/16/1/46</a></p> <p>4.

This meetup will follow the \"One Month Rails\" video series (<a href=\"https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails\"><a href=\"https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails\" class=\"linkified\">https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails</a></a>) which teaches anyone (including beginners) how to create a simple application using Ruby on Rails. In addition to Ruby, you will also learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Bootstrap 3 framework. It's perfect for complete beginners to coding or people who are interested in learning Rails development!</p> <p><br/>This meetup is \"flipped classroom\" style - attendees will watch the video tutorials and complete exercises during the week, and at the meetup we will review the week's lessons, answer any questions and do additional exercises to deepen our knowledge of web technologies. At the end of the 5 week meetup, we will show the applications we built!</p> <p>Because we are using the \"One Month Rails\" coursework this meetup will require attendees to pay for online access to the video tutorials. This comes to $70 a person (30% discount for Women Who Code members included.) We will give out the promo code during the first meetup and set up our environments so that everyone is ready to go when they leave the event</p> <p>Attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops to meetups so we can go over any code questions you may have.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Schedule</b>:</p> <p>Week 1 (11/12-) Sign up for OMR, Github and Nitrous. Brainstorm Course Expectations and Ideas</p> <p>Week 2 (11/19)- Review Week 1 and go over challenges with first week videos.</p> <p>Week 3 (TBD)- It will be either held on 12/2 or 12/4 due to the big holiday event for the tech community \"Tech the Halls\". \u00a0During this session it will be a review of Week 2 and challenges of second week videos</p> <p>Week 4 (12/10)- Review of Week 3 and the challenges of week 3 videos\u00a0</p> <p>Week 5 (12/17)- Last meeting before the holiday during this session we will do a review on Week 4 and challenges of Week 4 videos as well as discuss ideas for continuing meetup in January of 2015</p> <p><i>*Everything is subject to change base on the needs of everyone within the group.</i></p> <p>Please, please modify your RSVPs if you cannot make it for all 5 meet ups to allow those on the wait list to RSVP. We look forward to seeing you! Thanks!!</p>",

Then, let's get practical and walk through how to launch a web app. For January, a tech founder will share the intersection of her subject matter expertise with tech, discussing how localization (fitting a site or piece of software to a culture, often including language) interacts with design and development. Then, one of our web dev members will show us the simple steps to deploy a web app.</p> <p><b>Terena Bell</b> is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php\">In Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage\">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p> <p>Say the word \"language\" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p><b>Mandy Moore</b> is a Junior Developer at Mobility Labs and a recent graduate of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.\u00a0 In her talk she'll show you how you can share your projects with the world for free by deploying to Heroku using Git.\u00a0 Basic knowledge of Git, a free Heroku account and a small project to deploy will be helpful but not required.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nIf you're considering joining, please read our rules, to determine if this group is right for you:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/</a></p>",
