Regardless of what we\u2019re designing--a website, an Android app, or a toaster--we all strive to make our designs useful, easy to use, and enjoyable to use. But how exactly do we make something useful, easy to use, and enjoyable? How do we know if the target audience is having a good or bad experience? This class will arm you with the essential tips to find those answers.</p> <p>This class is for anyone who currently makes (or wants to learn how to make) websites, mobile apps, or other software. If you\u2019re a developer, a designer, a project manager, a content creator, or something else, you can integrate UX research and design into your practice.</p> <p>The contents that this class will cover include:</p> <p>\u2022 \u00a0Fundamental concepts of user experience design (what UX is and why you should care)</p> <p>\u2022 Creating user personas</p> <p>\u2022 Identifying usability problems and prioritizing solutions</p> <p>\u2022 How to design and run usability tests</p> <p>\u2022 Getting useful feedback from your users</p> <p>\u2022 Information Architecture and interaction design</p> <p>\u2022 Where UX fits with project management methodologies</p> <p>\u2022 And much, much more!</p> <p>This is a hands on course which will give you actionable tools to get started with user experience in your work day!

All of us are called upon at some point to manipulate a string or two. Regular expressions are a powerful tool that requires some serious logical thinking. We'll talk about why websites, in the year 2014, still require us to type in our phone numbers with their scheme of dashes and parentheses. (Answer: they're bad at regular expressions, but we can do better.) Tips from Python, Bash, and Java should help illustrate practice, and we'll talk theory as well.</p> <p>Then, Elaine leads us through an interview question. We'll practice in groups how to interpret a question, how to think about it, and how to format a response.</p> <p>Pizza arrives around 6:30 and we'll start to introduce ourselves around 7.

Conceived by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman from Stanford, the Lasso performs dimension reduction and variable selection, making it well suited for the high dimensionality of today's datasets. In this talk, Jared will go over some of the math behind the Lasso and discuss some recent advancements in performing statistical inference on Lasso-fitted models. He will also show the R code behind the results.

Maybe you want to code with other people but are tired of sending zip files back and forth via email? Are you just getting started coding and want to learn best practices for how and where you should save it?</p> <p>This meetup will introduce you to Git, a version control system. This event is perfect for beginners as we'll show you the tool many developers use to collaborate and back up code. If you're a developer and you are not using a version control system, you should come out too as it's an absolute must for a developer's workflow.</p> <p>This event will be hands-on, so we encourage you to bring your laptops as we'll be doing real examples and practicing together. If you want to get ahead of the curve, you can sign up for a free account over at Github.com and start reading some of their documentation.</p>",

Join us for an evening of drawing and tracing beautiful maps at this special Maptime.</p> <p>Inspiration and activities here: <a href=\"https://github.com/ddai/hand-drawn-maps\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/ddai/hand-drawn-maps</a> Don't forget to bring your art supplies: sharpies, markers, crayons, highlighters, etc!</p> <p>**</p> <p>Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.</p> <p>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.</p> <p>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?</p> <p>For more information about Maptime, visit maptime.io. Also, follow us on twitter at @MaptimeDC.</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like hyperlapse mashups]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like inverted circuit wallpaper]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

For January, a founder will share the intersection of her subject matter expertise with tech, discussing how localization (fitting a site or piece of software to a culture, often including language) interacts with design and development. Then, we'll break for some interactive coding fun!</p> <p>Terena Bell is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php\">In Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage\">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p> <p>Say the word \"language\" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p>If you're considering joining, please read our rules, to determine if this group is right for you:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/</a></p>",
