What does that mean for \u201csmart data\" applications?\u00a0Big Data contains noise and associated liabilities. We need \u201cSmart Data\u201d - filtering out the noise and holding onto valuable components and their interrelationships.</p> <p>We must also produce best practices that move us from merely identifying correlation to revealing meaningful causation. We need to leverage new data capabilities that hold a promise of improving speed, precision or accuracy, such as deep learning, semantic technologies, etc., which are themselves emerging technologies.\u00a0In this session we will explore 3 case studies, their successful outcomes and in layman\u2019s terms \u2013 a unique approach to producing \"Smart Data\" that holds a promise of better managing complex systems.</p> <p><b>Bios:</b></p> <p><br/><b>Aman Bhandari</b></p> <p>Aman is currently at Merck where he is building data science capabilities across the world. Prior to Merck,\u00a0he\u00a0worked on President Obama\u2019s tech team at the\u00a0White\u00a0House, where he was responsible for health data and health IT initiatives and was on the core team that implemented the President\u2019s \u00a0open data and innovation initiatives.\u00a0Aman has worked extensively across corporate, academic and government settings and has advised data, tech and innovation initiatives from the World Bank, Harvard, Cornell, Ashoka Foundation, Knight News Foundation, SXSW and others. He holds a master\u2019s degree in epidemiology and a doctorate in health systems research.</p> <p><b>Susan Bennett</b></p> <p>Susan's\u00a020 years of business experience and executive management include practices in engineering, product development, sales &amp; marketing within the oil &amp; gas, telecommunications, agriculture and\u00a0life science-healthcare industries. Having recently started\u00a0to work for\u00a0Merck, she is a member of an innovation team that leads a facet of the information technology strategic planning. Her commitment includes defining critical business questions and translating them into an analytics agenda. Prior to Merck, in December 2008\u00a0Susan\u00a0co-founded CrossInnovation, LLC\u00a0and was subsequently\u00a0acquired by Accelerated Vision Group, LLC in March 2013.\u00a0At those organizations,\u00a0she led\u00a0a talented team that\u00a0successfully implemented a cognitive computing platform emanating from the US Intelligence community to solve business problems in retail, oil &amp; gas and healthcare. Susan\u00a0earned a B.Sc. in Systems Design Engineering from University of Waterloo, Canada.\u00a0She relocated to Overland Park, Kansas in 2002 when another start-up she was working for was acquired by Marconi (now Ericsson).

Presentation signups are here:</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

Often by the time a solution is in place, the business needs have changed. With all the talk about Agile development methods like SCRUM and Extreme Programming, the question arises as to how these approaches can be used to deliver data warehouse and business intelligence projects faster. This presentation will look at the 12 principles behind the Agile Manifesto and see how they can be applied in the context of a data warehouse project. The goal is to determine a method or methods to get a more rapid (2-4 weeks) delivery of portions of an enterprise data warehouse architecture. Real world examples with metrics will be discussed.</p> <p><br/><b>Speaker</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kentgraziano\">Kent Graziano</a> is a Senior Technical Evangelist with Snowflake Computing and the author of The Data Warrior blog (<a href=\"http://kentgraziano.com/\"><a href=\"http://kentgraziano.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://kentgraziano.com</a></a>).\u00a0 He is a certified Data Vault Master (CDVP2), Oracle ACE Director, expert data modeler and architect with over 30 years of experience, including 25 years doing data warehousing with multiple architectures.

In 2014, Google released Kubernetes, the open source container orchestration tool built on the same concepts they use to manage the largest public infrastructure deployment in the world - their own.\u00a0</p> <p>Almost\u00a0two years later, Kubernetes is a mature, sophisticated and, dare we say, easy to use orchestration solution. Come hear David Aronchick, lead product manager for Kubernetes project, and a core engineer on Kubernetes team, talk about the present (and future) of Kubernetes, and how to use it to solve development and business blockers.</p> <p><b>Speaker</b>:\u00a0David Aronchick - \u00a0Lead Product Manager for Kubernetes project</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aronchick\">@aronchick</a>\u00a0</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/3/0/4/600_449617636.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease make sure to Fill the First and Last Name to gain access to the building.</p> <p><b>Sponsors</b>: Google Cloud Platform\u00a0</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/8/8/7/600_448582663.jpeg\" /></p>",
