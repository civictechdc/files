Plotly's APIs and web app let teams work together online to make 2D, 3D, and streaming graphs using R, Python, MATLAB, Julia, SAS, and and Excel, all together, all in one platform. The goal is to support technical and non-technical collaboration at all levels. Plotly translates ggplot2, matplotlib, and MATLAB plots into interactive, web-based, shareable plots. Graphs are rendered in D3.js (a popular JavaScript visualization library), and interactive out of the box. Plotly is free for unlimited public sharing, lets you control privacy and collaboratively edit graphs from different languages and environments, and you always own your data. The goal is to be a GitHub for sharing data and plots.</p> <p>In this talk, we'll make graphs with Plotly's APIs (<a href=\"https://plot.ly/api\" class=\"linkified\">https://plot.ly/api</a>), and use Plotly's statistical tools, data analysis tools, and web app. We'll show how Plotly and the new IPython kernels for multiple languages support plotting across languages and libraries. We'll also discuss data visualization concepts and ideas.</p> <p>About the speaker:<br/>Matt Sundquist is a co-founder and COO at Plotly, a graphing and analytics project. Matt studied philosophy at Harvard College, then worked as a writer for SCOTUSblog.com and for Akin Gump's Supreme Court practice. He was a Fulbright Scholar in Argentina, and a Student Fellow of the Harvard Law School Program on the Legal Profession. He previously worked on the Privacy Team at Facebook. He has published articles on the Supreme Court, privacy, the social contract, and sundials. He has been cited in Senate Judiciary Committee Testimony, the New York Times, and Yale Law Journal and is a member of the CA Vital Statistics Advisory Committee. He lives in San Francisco.</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like inverted circuit wallpaper]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

For January, a founder will share the intersection of her subject matter expertise with tech, discussing how localization (fitting a site or piece of software to a culture, often including language) interacts with design and development. Then, we'll break for some interactive coding fun!</p> <p>Terena Bell is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php\">In Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage\">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p> <p>Say the word \"language\" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p>If you're considering joining, please read our rules, to determine if this group is right for you:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/</a></p>",
