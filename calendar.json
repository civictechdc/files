This talk will introduce Apache Pirk - a new incubating Apache project designed to provide a framework for scalable, distributed PIR. We will discuss the motivation for Apache Pirk, its distributed implementations in platforms such as Spark and Storm, it\u2019s current algorithms, the power of homomorphic encryption, and take a look at the path forward.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p> <p>Ellison Anne Williams is a creator and PMC member of Apache Pirk, a pure mathematician by training, and a practical computer scientist in real life.
