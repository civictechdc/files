Or are you a data science/ML/AI guru who can't get enough of Major League Baseball?</p> <p>The Baseball Analytics Hackathon, hosted by the Baltimore Orioles and Booz Allen Hamilton, is the perfect opportunity to work with baseball executives and data scientists to refine your data science and analytic skills and show off your creativity by finding new ways to change the game. Hackathon participants will work to develop innovative data science and visualization solutions using unique datasets that we will provide alongside anything else that is openly available on the Internet. We hope that bringing together creative minds in a competitive environment will lead to novel solutions to some of the questions that the baseball industry is trying to answer.</p> <p>Please register at\u00a0<a href=\"http://baseballhackathon.eventbrite.com/\">baseballhackathon.eventbrite.com</a></p> <p>Please e-mail Kevin Tenenbaum at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a>\u00a0with any questions.</p>",

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got!

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

One of the current challenges has been to create a new patent search for examiners. The challenge is not only to make patents for the united states available to the examiners, but eventually all of the patent organizations around the world.\u00a0</p> <p>Examiners have a lot of domain knowledge and the way they query the current system must be maintained. It's a little more complicated than boolean queries, and less complicated than natural language search. Rahul will talk about his experience in working on and improving a system built on Java, Scala, Cassandra, Spark, SolR, Dojo, jQuery UI. The goal is for you to understand how large scale organizations deal with changing technology and some business and technology take aways.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Rahul Singh is a technology minded business person and a business minded technologist. As CEO of a company devoted to solving the most difficult problems in streamlining, organizing, and unifying business information, he is responsible for training the team, overseeing and creating technology with the research and development team, and fostering client and service partner relationships.\u00a0</p> <p>Although he\u2019s programmed in over 30 computer languages and has worked with numerous platforms, frameworks, and libraries across all major internet software systems, he likes to spend his time sharpening his skills in information retrieval (search), knowledge management, business information systems, and machine learning to come up with ideas for a smarter, more modern enterprise.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Hack &amp;&amp; Tell will be at WeWork Chinatown this month! Everyone is looking forward to hearing about *your* cool hack. Presentation signups are here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup! We try to start on-time at 6:30. Sometimes we have free food (bonus!). Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>",
