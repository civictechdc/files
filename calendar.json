Then, one of our web dev members will show us the simple steps to deploy a web app.</p> <p><b>Terena Bell</b> is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php\">In Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage\">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p> <p>Say the word \"language\" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p><b>Mandy Moore</b> is a Junior Developer at Mobility Labs and a recent graduate of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.\u00a0 In her talk she'll show you how you can share your projects with the world for free by deploying to Heroku using Git.\u00a0 Basic knowledge of Git, a free Heroku account and a small project to deploy will be helpful but not required.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nIf you're considering joining, please read our rules, to determine if this group is right for you:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-Washington-DC/about/</a></p>",
