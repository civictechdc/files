This week the <a href=\"http://cadasta.org\">Cadasta Foundation</a> is in town (all together for the first time)! They are working to build a future where, through technology and community partnership, land and resource rights are universally recognized and protected. They'd like to share what they are working on and things that excite them with the GeoDC community. It's a packed agenda - but they're sticking to our lightening talk theme!\u00a0</p> <p><br/>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eomwandho\">Erick Opiyo</a>: Using GeoODK to document land rights. GeoODK is a mobile data collection application built on top of OpenDataKit. This talk will go over how it works and how it is being used to collect land rights info.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/fhpichel\">Frank Pichel</a>: Cadasta is building an open-source platform to help communities document their land rights. Learn more about why land matters and how technology can help.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wonderchook\">Kate Chapman</a>: Imagery is a key aspect to mapping community land boundaries. Learn how imagery is used and what developments are helping reduce costs.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/linzjax\">Lindsey Jacks</a>: Field Papers allows people to easily print atlases, sketch on those maps and then upload them again to transcribe their notes. Recently Cadasta sponsored an internship to redesign the atlas making interface to make it more user friendly. Learn what we did and what we might do next.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lindsay_Joelle\">Lindsay Ferris</a>: Combining maps with open data on land tenure can help paint a clearer picture of property ownership within a country. Cadasta is sponsoring a research fellowship to define open data in land and identify key open government datasets that can strengthen property rights. We\u2019ll share what we\u2019re learning and what we hope to accomplish through this initiative.</p> <p>Join us for what promises to be a fascinating and fabulous night!\u00a0</p>",

We welcome devs of all levels and encourage those with more experience to help out those that are just starting.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!

            "description": "<p>The United States Patent Office has been trying to innovate and replace closed systems with systems built on open or open source technologies. One of the current challenges has been to create a new patent search for examiners. The challenge is not only to make patents for the united states available to the examiners, but eventually all of the patent organizations around the world.\u00a0</p> <p>Examiners have a lot of domain knowledge and the way they query the current system must be maintained. It's a little more complicated than boolean queries, and less complicated than natural language search. Rahul will talk about his experience in working on and improving a system built on Java, Scala, Cassandra, Spark, SolR, Dojo, jQuery UI. The goal is for you to understand how large scale organizations deal with changing technology and some business and technology take aways.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Rahul Singh is a technology minded business person and a business minded technologist. As CEO of a company devoted to solving the most difficult problems in streamlining, organizing, and unifying business information, he is responsible for training the team, overseeing and creating technology with the research and development team, and fostering client and service partner relationships.\u00a0</p> <p>Although he\u2019s programmed in over 30 computer languages and has worked with numerous platforms, frameworks, and libraries across all major internet software systems, he likes to spend his time sharpening his skills in information retrieval (search), knowledge management, business information systems, and machine learning to come up with ideas for a smarter, more modern enterprise.</p>",
