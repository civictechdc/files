Or do you simply want to learn what the differences are between Python, Ruby,\u00a0HTML,\u00a0CSS, Java, Javascript, and the seemingly endless number of terms you hear when people talk about programming?</p> <p>This meetup will introduce you to many common terms that might otherwise look like alphabet soup when you first start out. We will start from the ground up to explain what each language is useful for, and what makes them different from each other.</p> <p>This event is perfect for beginners trying to decide which coding \"path\" to take. It is also useful for developers who\u00a0to expand their\u00a0high-level understanding of new languages!</p> <p>This talk was an absolute hit when we first presented it in D.C.

We will be discussing The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer. <a href=\"http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/the-book/\" class=\"linkified\">http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/the-book/</a>. Join us for a great discussion and celebration of Ada Lovelace! (with some surprises in store)</p> <p>Book Description : This AWESOME graphic novel follows the story of Ada Lovelace (whose writings contained the first ever appearance of general computing theory) and Charles Babbage (eccentric inventor of the Difference Engine, an enormous clockwork calculating machine that would have been the first computer, if he had ever finished it.) But what if things had been different? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage presents a delightful alternate reality in which Lovelace and Babbage do build the Difference Engine and use it to create runaway economic models, battle the scourge of spelling errors, explore the wider realms of mathematics and, of course, fight crime.</p> <p>\n\n\n**This event is a part of DC Fem Tech's Tour de Code: A month long celebration of coding and tech events.

As though the folks reading our blogs and following our accounts have the same nuanced understanding of a given issue as those working full time on it. This can severely limit your audience. Non-profits can avoid this common pitfall and make content that is compelling to a wider audience by borrowing some basic research methods and formal work processes from the field of advertising account planning. Those methods and work processes will be the focus of this talk.</p> <p>We begin at 6:30 with networking, drinks and appetizers. Presentations start at 7pm.</p> <p><br/><b>SPEAKERS</b></p> <p><b>Mike Pressendo, Director of Communications at UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing)</b></p> <p>Mike Pressendo joined UNOS in 2014 as Director of Communications. Pressendo leads a comprehensive communications department including media and external relations, member relations, reputation and image building, brand management, web services and social media, design services and internal communications. He works with leadership to produce a communications strategy for the organization and orchestrate the plan for sharing UNOS\u2019 lifesaving message. Before joining UNOS, Pressendo was most recently the Vice President of Communications for The Federal Reserve National IT, the largest entity within the Federal Reserve System. Previously he led marketing and fundraising efforts at ChildFund International during its rebranding from Christian Children\u2019s Fund and branding and marketing at the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. He also held leadership positions with Aetna, Adcom Communications and Gordon C. James Public Relations. Pressendo earned his Bachelors of Science in organizational communications from Arizona State University. He also holds a certificate in Spanish and bilingual multicultural studies from Universidad Internacional in Cuernavaca, Mexico.</p> <p><br/><b>Brad Perry, Director of Strategy, Create Digital</b></p> <p>After briefly attempting to become a journalist, I detoured to a graduate degree in social psychology and a career in gender-based violence prevention and communications at a non-profit. Eventually, I ended up at the VCU Brandcenter to pursue a fascination with branding on the Interwebz. I am currently Director of Strategy at Create Digital where I've helped develop several award-winning digital campaigns, including the Play Like A Girl campaign for Verizon FiOS which won \"Best Social Media Campaign 2014\" from the Online Media &amp; Marketing Association.

Multiple scholarly analyses of the historical record have shown how the climate is already changing and impacting virtually almost all parts of our blue planet, whereas massively parallel General Circulation Model simulations paint a vivid picture of what lies ahead in the coming decades through the end of the century. These simulations derive their basis from various disciplines including physics, chemistry, ecology, statistics, engineering, and even economics. Data Science is the invisible thread that connects these interdisciplinary strands into a unified model. The objective of this presentation is to provide a brief overview of the methods, both statistical and dynamical, used in the speaker's specialization of high-resolution climate simulations. It concludes with a case study drawn from the speaker's recent research.</p> <p>Speaker</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pracherla9\">Pavan Racherla</a>\u00a0has a Ph.D. in Engineering &amp; Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University (2007), wherein his thesis was on \u201cThe Sensitivity of Ozone and Particulate Matter Concentrations to Climate Change at Various Spatiotemporal Scales.\u201d He worked thereafter as a Postdoctoral and Associate Research Scientist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies [masked]). He is currently \u00a0Principal Researcher at a nonprofit organization called NextClimate.

The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes].

This happens literally in a Word or Google Doc. That's the 'platform' for content design. Lo-fi, inexpensive and quick testing that mitigates rounds and rounds of UX testing.\u00a0</p> <p>We then conduct content testing with customers and prospects using a variety of methods and tools, which I think the group would find interesting and helpful. The objective? To see what WORDS resonate (and fail) BEFORE UX begins.\u00a0</p> <p>All this happens before we pass anything off to designers and in concert with\u00a0presentations and workshop with designers, product owners and others across the organization to ensure they understand the Content-First approach, and can incorporate humanity into everything they do.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Speakers</b></p> <p><b>Cory Jurentkoff</b><br/>Manager, Content Strategy, Digital Innovation &amp; Design<br/>Capital One</p> <p>Other Capital One speakers will be announced as they are confirmed.</p>",
