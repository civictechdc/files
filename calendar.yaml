  description: "<p>Our workflows are, with few exceptions, entirely digital. This\
    \ is fantastic for productivity, accuracy, and a million other reasons- but by\
    \ building in the same tools we risk uniformity in output. There are endless ways\
    \ to make something look custom, but one of the best is to simply incorporate\
    \ illustrative elements- whether they be a hand drawn pattern, icon marker, or\
    \ classic marginalia.</p> <p>Sometimes it's nice to take a break from the digital\
    \ screens of our lives and bust out the pen and paper. Join us for an evening\
    \ of drawing and tracing beautiful maps at this special Maptime.</p> <p>Dylan\
    \ will go over when illustrative embellishments are appropriate, and some techniques\
    \ he's found useful for bringing handy work to the digital world. If you have\
    \ hesitations based on self perceived art skills, please don't let that discourage\
    \ you! There is still a lot you can do, we promise.</p> <p>Inspiration and some\

    \ Drinks</p> <p><br/><b>More about Mark McDonald </b></p> <p>A 30 year veteran\
    \ of the news industry, Mark has defined his career as a news producer by working\
    \ at the highest levels of international news, starting at the BBC TV News production\
    \ in the 80s, Mark served the BBC as a World Duty Editor, and in the field in\
    \ both Western and Eastern Europe, and extensively throughout North and South\
    \ America. While working for the BBC his work included coverage, both short and\
    \ long-form, of international politics, five U.S. Presidential elections, battlefield\
    \ conflict, diplomacy, the United Nations and its agencies, as well as natural\
    \ and human tragedies.</p> <p>In the 90s Mark made the intrepid voyage across\
    \ the Atlantic via jet airplane to hold senior management positions with the BBC\u2019\
    s New York Bureau before transferring to US Public Radio, serving senior positions\
    \ at WNYC in New York, where he built a stellar reporting team that won the Edward\
    \ R. Murrow Award and the DuPont Columbia Award for investigative reporting. \_\
    After Mark left New York he became Programming Director WAMU in Washington, DC,\
    \ in this position he brought podcasting, internet streaming, and digital content\
    \ management to WAMU, expanding the station\u2019s range and increasing the listing\
    \ base dramatically.</p> <p>Mark is the founder and CEO of Birkdale Media, a boutique\
    \ media and public relations firm; Birkdale specializes in media coaching, interview\
    \ preparation, public relations for individuals and for corporations.</p> <p>Above\
    \ all else, Mark is a champion for data and data visualization in the newsroom\
    \ and on the air. \_We conducted an interview with him and were really impressed\
    \ by the passion he displayed for Data Viz \u2013 full text of the interview below:</p>\
    \ <p><br/>1) What got you into data visualization and how do you think data visualization\
    \ has enhanced your profession?\_</p> <p><b>Mark: </b>TV and Video Graphics have\
    \ become so much more sophisticated in the digital age that they can be designed\
    \ much more quickly, easily, and contain much more useful information for viewers,\
    \ helping producers to explain complex stories and issues, and put them into better\
    \ context than ever before. The internet means blogs, news-sites, etc. can contain\
    \ way more vital information\_and background than they did before - and many organizations\
    \ are utilizing data to enhance their story-telling, provide background, history,\
    \ and further detail.\_</p> <p>\n\n\n2) You worked for the BBC, how do you think\
    \ that working for an international news agency affected your views on data?\_\
    </p> <p><b>Mark:\_</b>In my day (80's and 90's) a sophisticated graphic could\
    \ take days, even weeks to assemble to be inserted into a news report. New technology\
    \ speeds this process meaning producers can make much better use of graphics on\
    \ video and on the web.\_</p> <p>\n\n\n3) How do you see data visualization shaping\
    \ the future of news media or vice versa how do you see news media shaping the\
    \ path of data visualization?\_</p> <p><b>Mark:\_</b>It opens up vast new possibilities\
    \ for journalism. Better analysis, better explanations and details in investigative\
    \ work (being able to collate and display complex documents, and show how they\
    \ relate to each other, for instance). The news media in turn can drive the quest\
    \ for big data using the Freedom of Information legislation on complex stories\
    \ and issues and making it public utilizing graphics and big data.\_</p> <p>\n\
    \n\n4) How do we make the news - print, media, digital, etc.- Great Again?\_</p>\
    \ <p><b>Mark:\_</b>By using our imagination about how to tell stories and raise\
    \ important issues in a more captivating and compelling way, rather than feeding\
    \ the public cheap consumer-driven news which is often second or third hand.\_\
    </p> <p>\n\n\n5) What international news story from the past decade could have\
    \ had a different outcome if data visualization was better used in covering it?\_\
    </p> <p><b>Mark:\_</b>Resolution from any conflict zone you care to mention -\
    \ by using big data to report it more accurately (Iraq, for example) thus raising\
    \ public awareness.\_</p> <p><br/><b>Sponsor Announcements: </b></p> <p><img src=\"\

    \ Wrangling and Data Preparation have emerged as key topics in the world of Information\

    \ with these terms, let alone the details these topics.\_ Data volumes are growing\
    \ exponentially, the speed at which data crosses people's desks increases almost\
    \ daily, and the various types of data to be analyzed can be overwhelming.\_ The\
    \ industry has developed a powerful range of tools to store data and an equally\
    \ powerful range of tools to analyze data.\_ However, to date, there has not a\
    \ been significant amount of focus on careful preparation and active manipulation\
    \ of this data to allow for more thorough approaches to data and business analytics.\_\
    \ This presentation will cover relevant background and provide a foundation for\
