  description: "<p>Hack and Tell will be at WeWork Chinatown again in August! (Hooray!)\
    \ Everyone is looking forward to hearing about *your* cool hack! Presentation\
    \ signups are here:</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"\

    \ <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe format is informal, engaging, and friendly:\
    \ presenters have 5 minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019\
    d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and\
    \ suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are anything from\
    \ how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something more serious...\
    \ like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember:\
    \ no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form\
    \ to let us know:\_<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"\
    \ class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup! We'll start close to seven. There may be a\
    \ couple beers. It's going to be fun! :) Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us!\
    \ We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>"

  description: <p>The <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a> package
    for R provides a unified domain-specific language for tabular data. A powerful
    feature is that it supports multiple sources of tabular data, including data.frames,
    data.tables, and several dialects of relational database. But data.frames are
    not databases! How can this work? In this talk, I will dive into the details of
    how high-level dplyr verbs get translated into SQL, and walk through tips and
    tricks, optimizations, and gotchas.</p> <p><b>Our Instructor - Harlan Harris</b></p>

    Machine Learning, Enterprise Software, Operations Research, Analytical Marketing,
    Enterprise Analytics, Higher Education, Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Modeling,

    statistical, mathematical, computational, and scientific methods to understanding
