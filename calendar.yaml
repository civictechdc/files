  description: "<p>You must register on <a href=\"http://wcm-networking.eventbrite.com\"\
    >Eventbrite</a>. Use the code WCM for $5 off.</p> <p>Networking isn't just for\
    \ jobs. It's for helping you with sales, funding, ideas and support. It's for\
    \ the long-term relationships that remind someone of you when they have a position\
    \ or allow you to reach out when you need an introduction. It's about building\
    \ professional connections that create value for you and for them. And sometimes\
    \ it's about building friendships.</p> <p>And if you aren't networking or aren't\
    \ doing it effectively...this class is for you.</p> <p><b>You should join us...</b></p>\
    \ <p><br/>- If you've ever felt awkward at a conference or a party, wondered how\
    \ to break into a conversation pod, pretended to be busy on your phone to hide\
    \ your shyness or otherwise wondered how to network in person</p> <p>- If you're\
    \ comfortable with people but never seem to close any deals or develop relationships\
    \ out of events</p> <p>- If you are considering a career change and need a refresher</p>\
    \ <p><i><b>**PLUS:\_</b></i>we have a practice session over food &amp; drinks!\
    \ <b>**</b></p> <p><b>How it works</b></p> <p>We start with class, have a practice\
    \ break with drinks &amp; food, unpack the experience in the 2nd session and then\
    \ hang out after to further sharpen skills.</p> <p><b>What we'll cover</b></p>\
    \ <p><i>Gearing up</i>: finding good networking opportunities, creating an introduction\
    \ and networking pitch, pre-event planning.</p> <p><i>Mechanics</i>: how to enter\
    \ &amp; exit conversations, where to stand for maximum value,\_</p> <p><i>Handling\
    \ Challenges</i>:\_how to deal with challenging people, dealing with shyness and\
    \ other quirks</p> <p><i>Effective follow up and how to maximize your networking\
    \ reach</i>: email followup, twitter and other social media rules, ideas for staying\
    \ visible without being annoying</p> <p>After the workshop there will be optional\
    \ practice networking so you can put what you've learned to the test!</p> <p><b>Instructor</b></p>\

  description: "<p><b>Say you're building a simple website with five pages linked\
    \ together, and a simple navigation bar at the top. You make some changes to the\
    \ code and want to know if everything still works. So you open your local version\
    \ of the webpage and click through each button on the navigation bar to make sure\
    \ they each still lead to the right destination. Not hard, and it doesn't take\
    \ long.</b></p> <p>But now imagine you make some changes to a more complex app--one\
    \ with 20 pages, a login system, various forms, and content that should look different\
    \ depending on which type of user you're logged in as. You could come up with\
    \ a checklist of all the buttons you'd have to manually click on\u2014and forms\
    \ you\u2019d have to test-submit in various ways\u2014while logged in as various\
    \ different users, checking to make sure your changes didn\u2019t accidentally\
    \ blow up an obscure but necessary function of your website. Repeating a long\
    \ list of tests every time you make a small update to your app would get repetitive\
    \ and tedious.\_</p> <p>Thankfully, computers love doing repetitive and tedious\
    \ tasks for us! Automated testing\u2014when we write code to perform tests on\
    \ other code\u2014helps us as developers to save time, expose poorly written code,\
    \ confidently expand or update our apps, sleep better at night knowing that bugs\
    \ are permanently addressed, and even think more critically when we sit down to\
    \ write an app from scratch.\_</p> <p>In this meetup we'll examine one of the\
    \ most popular testing frameworks for Rails applications, called RSpec.\_</p>\

    \ The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text\
    \ you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out\

    \ Wrangling and Data Preparation have emerged as key topics in the world of Information\
    \ Management and Business\_Analytics.\_ However, many people are not familiar\
    \ with these terms, let alone the details these topics.\_ Data volumes are growing\
    \ exponentially, the speed at which data crosses people's desks increases almost\
    \ daily, and the various types of data to be analyzed can be overwhelming.\_ The\
    \ industry has developed a powerful range of tools to store data and an equally\
    \ powerful range of tools to analyze data.\_ However, to date, there has not a\
    \ been significant amount of focus on careful preparation and active manipulation\
    \ of this data to allow for more thorough approaches to data and business analytics.\_\
    \ This presentation will cover relevant background and provide a foundation for\
    \ understanding the business value of Data Wrangling.\_ Topics include:</p> <p><br/>What\
    \ is Data Wrangling?</p> <p>\u2022\_Data Wrangling vs. Data Preparation</p> <p>\u2022\
    \_Market and Analyst Overview</p> <p>\u2022\_Common Data Wrangling Tasks</p> <p>\u2022\
