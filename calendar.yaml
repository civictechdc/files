  description: "<p>The United States Patent Office has been trying to innovate and\
    \ replace closed systems with systems built on open or open source technologies.\
    \ One of the current challenges has been to create a new patent search for examiners.\
    \ The challenge is not only to make patents for the united states available to\
    \ the examiners, but eventually all of the patent organizations around the world.\_\
    </p> <p>Examiners have a lot of domain knowledge and the way they query the current\
    \ system must be maintained. It's a little more complicated than boolean queries,\
    \ and less complicated than natural language search. Rahul will talk about his\
    \ experience in working on and improving a system built on Java, Scala, Cassandra,\
    \ Spark, SolR, Dojo, jQuery UI. The goal is for you to understand how large scale\
    \ organizations deal with changing technology and some business and technology\
    \ take aways.\_</p> <p><br/><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Rahul Singh is a technology\
    \ minded business person and a business minded technologist. As CEO of a company\
    \ devoted to solving the most difficult problems in streamlining, organizing,\
    \ and unifying business information, he is responsible for training the team,\
    \ overseeing and creating technology with the research and development team, and\
    \ fostering client and service partner relationships.\_</p> <p>Although he\u2019\
    s programmed in over 30 computer languages and has worked with numerous platforms,\

  description: "<p>Hack &amp;&amp; Tell will be at WeWork Chinatown this month! Everyone\
    \ is looking forward to hearing about *your* cool hack. Presentation signups are\
    \ here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p>\
    \ <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes\
    \ to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the\
    \ audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback.\
    \ The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text\
    \ you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out\
    \ of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches,\
    \ no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting,\
    \ complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"\
    \ class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!\
    \ We try to start on-time at 6:30. Sometimes we have free food (bonus!). Big thanks\
    \ to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>"
