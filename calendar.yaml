  description: "<p>For July's meetup, we are honored to feature several data scientists\
    \ from Miner &amp; Kasch discussing recommendation\_engines, neural networks and\

    >Loyola Columbia</a></p> <p>8890 McGaw Rd #230,\_Columbia,\_MD</p> <p><b>Directions</b></p>\
    \ <p>There is ample free parking surrounding the building.</p> <p><b>Talks</b></p>\
    \ <p><b>Collaborative Filtering For Recommendation Engines<br/></b></p> <p>Collaborative\
    \ filtering is a method of making automatic, personalized predictions about the\
    \ tastes of a user by collecting and leveraging the taste preferences from other\
    \ users. The basis of the method assumes that the if users are known to share\
    \ preferences for items, those users are more likely to have the same preference\
    \ for other items. The method has had success in a variety of web-based markets,\
    \ including Amazon, iTunes, Netflix, and LastFM. This talk covers the basics behind\
    \ the collaborative filtering algorithm, it\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and\
    \ ways to augment it to make better recommendation engines.</p> <p><br/><b>Building\
    \ Successful Data Science Applications</b></p> <p><br/>Data Scientists are under\
    \ constant pressure to deliver the latest and greatest analytics that save or\
    \ make organizations loads of money. In this talk, I will draw upon real-life\
    \ experience to see what it takes to deliver successful data science applications\
    \ in industry. Using an example from the telecommunications industry, I will show\
    \ what business leaders need to do to put their data scientists into a position\
    \ to succeed, and what a data scientist (or team of data scientists) should do\
    \ to deliver high quality, reliable, and reproducible results - whether they are\
    \ positive or negative. By walking through the life cycle of an analytics project\
    \ I present the techniques and processes that foster trust in analytics and pave\
    \ the way to putting your data science work into production.</p> <p><br/><b>Recognizing\
    \ Novel Images using Pre-trained Neural Networks</b></p> <p><br/>While there exist\
    \ many pre-trained neural networks to do image recognition, it is often of interest\
    \ to classify images that these general networks are not typically trained on.\
    \ \_Training a neural network from scratch, however, can be quite a finicky, time\
    \ intensive process. \_However, it is possible to use these pre-trained neural\
    \ networks as featurizers for novel images, and then to classify them using traditional,\
    \ out of the box supervised learning methods.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p>\
    \ <p><b>Patrick Roos</b>\_has two decades of industry and research experience\
    \ using machine learning, data mining, distributed systems, and modeling to generate\
    \ knowledge from data and tools to leverage it. He has a successful track record\
    \ developing and applying big data\_analytics\_and predictive solutions across\
    \ a variety of fields, including finance, \_telecommunications, network science,\
    \ biomedical informatics and genomics, behavior modeling, digital media information\
    \ retrieval, and e-commerce recommender systems. He received his PhD in Computer\
