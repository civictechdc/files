  description: "<p>Spark is becoming increasingly popular for big data processing\
    \ and analytics with significant speed increases over other platforms such as\
    \ MapReduce. Commonly Spark interfaces with HDFS for data storage, but did you\
    \ know that Spark can also leverage the power of Cassandra? For our February event,\
