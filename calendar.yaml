  description: <p>Plotly (<a href="https://plot.ly" class="linkified">https://plot.ly</a>)
    is a new web-based platform for making graphs and analyzing data. Plotly's APIs
    and web app let teams work together online to make 2D, 3D, and streaming graphs
    using R, Python, MATLAB, Julia, SAS, and and Excel, all together, all in one platform.
    The goal is to support technical and non-technical collaboration at all levels.
    Plotly translates ggplot2, matplotlib, and MATLAB plots into interactive, web-based,
    shareable plots. Graphs are rendered in D3.js (a popular JavaScript visualization
    library), and interactive out of the box. Plotly is free for unlimited public
    sharing, lets you control privacy and collaboratively edit graphs from different
    languages and environments, and you always own your data. The goal is to be a
    GitHub for sharing data and plots.</p> <p>In this talk, we'll make graphs with
    Plotly's APIs (<a href="https://plot.ly/api" class="linkified">https://plot.ly/api</a>),
    and use Plotly's statistical tools, data analysis tools, and web app. We'll show
    how Plotly and the new IPython kernels for multiple languages support plotting
    across languages and libraries. We'll also discuss data visualization concepts
    and ideas.</p> <p>About the speaker:<br/>Matt Sundquist is a co-founder and COO
    at Plotly, a graphing and analytics project. Matt studied philosophy at Harvard
    College, then worked as a writer for SCOTUSblog.com and for Akin Gump's Supreme
    Court practice. He was a Fulbright Scholar in Argentina, and a Student Fellow
    of the Harvard Law School Program on the Legal Profession. He previously worked
    on the Privacy Team at Facebook. He has published articles on the Supreme Court,
    privacy, the social contract, and sundials. He has been cited in Senate Judiciary
    Committee Testimony, the New York Times, and Yale Law Journal and is a member
    of the CA Vital Statistics Advisory Committee. He lives in San Francisco.</p>

    \ <p><br/>Code &amp; Coffees are hosted bi-weekly. BYO-Projects and laptops for\
    \ a fun, informal way to learn, code and work on projects with other members in\
    \ the community. From Ruby on Rails to Javascript to CodeAcademy and HTML/CSS,\
    \ these events are open to all women or those who support women and minorities\
    \ in tech. Feel free to come early or stay later. These events are held at public\
    \ coffee shops, so good seats are on a first come first serve basis. Beginners\
    \ welcome!</p> <p><br/>Code &amp; Coffees are not coding workshops. No instructors,\
    \ no agenda, no lesson plan. These events are very informal so ladies will usually\
    \ bring their own projects or meet people who are working on similar projects\
    \ to collaborate together. If you're a beginner we recommend some online tutorials\
    \ like Code Academy or General Assembly Dash. The hope is that you will find ladies\
    \ who are learning similar coding languages and projects to work with or ask questions.</p>\
    \ <p><br/>When you arrive, we'll ask you to visit our Hackpad so we can all get\
    \ to know a little more about who is in the room! <a href=\"https://hackpad.com/Code-Coffee-no2YwWl8UVc\"\

    meetup will follow the "One Month Rails" video series (<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails"
    class="linkified">https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails</a>) which teaches
    anyone (including beginners) how to create a simple application using Ruby on
    Rails. In addition to Ruby, you will also learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the
    Bootstrap 3 framework. Attendees will watch the video tutorials and complete exercises
    during the week. At the meetup, we will review the week''s lessons, answer any
    questions and do additional exercises to deepen our knowledge of web technologies.
    At the end of the 5 week meetup, we will present the applications we built.</p>
    <p>Because we are using the "One Month Rails" coursework this meetup will require
    attendees to pay for online access to the video tutorials. This comes to $70 a
    person (30% discount for Women Who Code members included.)</p> <p>Attendees are
    encouraged to bring their laptops to meetups so we can go over any code questions
    you may have. Dates of this meetup will be: 11/12, 11/19, 12/3, 12/10, 12/17</p>'

  description: "<p>For our November Meetup, we're thrilled to have three speakers\
    \ on one of the most prominent domains for Data Science innovation -- Marketing.\
    \ From politics to products, predictive models have been fundamental for a number\
    \ of years in identifying what to sell, how to sell it, and who to sell it to.\
    \ Our speakers will dive into the technical details. <b>Rob Mealey</b> from NewBrand\
    \ will talk about how to incorporate unstructured social media data into models\
    \ of customer feedback. <b>David Young</b> from MarketShare will overview challenges\
    \ and best practices for Marketing Mix Modeling, optimizing the allocation of\
    \ dollars. And <b>Dan Porter</b> from BlueLabs will present persuasion modeling,\
    \ showing how you can estimate the impact of outreach to individual people. Whether\
    \ you work on marketing data or not, these talks will provide practical insights\
    \ into working with the complex, noisy data of real people making real decisions.</p>\
    \ <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\_6:30pm -- Networking, Empenadas, and Refreshments</p>\
    \ <p>\u2022\_7:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements, Give-aways</p> <p>\u2022\_\
    7:15pm -- Presentation and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\_8:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>Tonic,\_\
    2036 G St NW</i>)</p> <p><b>Talks:</b></p> <p><b>Rob Mealey</b> is Senior Technologist\
    \ for machine learning and data science solutions at <a href=\"http://www.newbrandanalytics.com/\"\
    >NewBrand</a>, a social media monitoring and online reputation management tool\
    \ that transforms online reviews into operational social intelligence.</p> <p><i>Abstract</i><b>:</b>\
    \ Incorporating unstructured data directly into your feature set can improve predictive\
    \ power of a model, sometimes significantly. However, there are some inherent\
    \ challenges in doing so that can confound even the most statistically sophisticated.\
    \ I'll walk through a couple basic approaches that can be used to do this, techniques\
    \ to be aware of, and their trade-offs and advantages.</p> <p><br/><b>David\_\
    Young</b> is a VP of Analytics for <a href=\"http://www.marketshare.com/\">MarketShare</a>,\
    \ the Marketing Mix Modeling vendor ranked highest in the industry by Forester\
    \ Research in both of their latest 2011 and 2013 industry studies. Previously\
    \ David\u2019s worked in the areas of Customer Targeting, Choice Modeling, and\
    \ Market Segmentation.</p> <p><i>Abstract</i>: Based in Time Series Analysis,\
    \ Marketing Mix Modeling aims to parse out the incremental impacts of all advertising\
    \ channels and non-media influences on sales, and optimize marketing budgets according\
    \ to which marginal investments offer the highest returns. \_Technically this\
    \ offers several challenges since the optimization requires estimates for all\
    \ medias. \_That requirement implies that correlated variables cannot be excluded\
    \ and that the magnitudes of individual coefficients are as, or more important,\
    \ than predictive accuracy. \_ The talk will cover a few of the unique technical\
    \ challenges encountered in MMM and how they can be addressed, as well as the\
    \ basic value proposition of the analysis.</p> <p><b>Daniel Porter</b> is a cofounder\
    \ and head of the Analytics Practice at BlueLabs, a Washington DC based analytics,\
    \ data and technology company formed by the lead practitioners from the Obama\
    \ 2012 Analytics Team.\_On the Obama campaign, Daniel was Director of Statistical\
    \ Modeling, where he and his team developed individual level statistical models\
    \ that were used throughout the campaign for fundraising, media buying and state\
    \ strategy.\_</p> <p><i>Abstract</i>: Marketing, political campaigning, and healthcare\
    \ have one major thing in common: millions of per-person treatment decisions must\
    \ be selected in order to drive positive outcomes.\_Prior to President Obama's\
    \ reelection campaign, standard practices for persuading voters\u2014that is,\
    \ changing their minds\u2014were unscientific and driven by long-standing assumptions\
    \ and hunches. This mirrors outreach efforts by other companies and organizations,\
    \ which know that a certain percentage of their marketing efforts will inevitably\
    \ be wasted on people who are not going to be receptive to it. Daniel will discuss\
    \ his experience using the results from a large-scale randomized, controlled experiment\
    \ to target persuadable voters for\_political campaigns, as well as ways these\
    \ cutting edge statistical modeling techniques can be applied to influencing behavior\
    \ in realms ranging from health outcomes to customer retention.\_</p> <p><b>Sponsors:</b></p>\

    \ as a member shows us how she built an Adafruit bracelet. Then, we'll see how\
    \ the data in a spreadsheet becomes a map that illustrates an important social\
    \ topic.</p> <p>First, Catherine Dodge will present on how she made a bracelet\
    \ out of Adafruit NeoPixel rings. She explains her project with her daughter:\
    \ <i>\"As a programmer who was getting a bit bored by programming, I resolved\
    \ that in the New Year I would learn to solder. Wires and hot metal, what's not\
    \ to like? I headed over to the Adafruit website which is teeming with fun, wearable\
    \ electronics projects. And made the mistake of promising my six year old daughter\
    \ I would make her any project she chose, to go with her Halloweeen costume. Deadline\
    \ established, could I hit it?\_ Follow our journey from Arduino to Amazon to\
    \ Adafruit as we learned to glue and solder and hack and sketch our way to a light-up\
    \ bracelet!\_ Bring your laptop if you'd like to get started with the Adafruit\
    \ development environment, we'll walk through setup.\"</i></p> <p><a href=\"http://shannonvturner.com/\"\
    >Shannon Turner</a>\_is a software developer and founder of\_<a href=\"http://hearmecode.com/\"\
    >Hear Me Code</a>, offering free, beginner-friendly coding classes for women in\
    \ the DC area. In her spare time she creates projects like\_<a href=\"http://shutthatdown.com/\"\
    >Shut That Down</a>\_and serves as a mentor with\_<a href=\"http://www.codeforprogress.org/\"\
    >Code for Progress</a>. She writes about her presentation: \"<i>Seriously?! is\
    \ a map of nearly 500 colleges and universities that reported having zero sexual\
    \ assaults over a three-year period.\_ I'll show you how I created the map from\
    \ concept to completion.\"</i></p> <p>As always, we gather around 6:30 over pizza\
    \ from our generous sponsor, Excella Consulting. We'll kick it off with intros\
    \ and announcements a little after 7. See you there!</p>"

    meetup will follow the "One Month Rails" video series (<a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails"
    class="linkified">https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails</a>) which teaches
    anyone (including beginners) how to create a simple application using Ruby on
    Rails. In addition to Ruby, you will also learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the
    Bootstrap 3 framework. Attendees will watch the video tutorials and complete exercises
    during the week. At the meetup, we will review the week''s lessons, answer any
    questions and do additional exercises to deepen our knowledge of web technologies.
    At the end of the 5 week meetup, we will present the applications we built.</p>

  description: <p>With the diverse skills and interests of our group, let's explore
    how the experience in our backgrounds plays into our tech careers. For January,
    a founder will share the intersection of her subject matter expertise with tech,
    discussing how localization (fitting a site or piece of software to a culture,
    often including language) interacts with design and development. Then, we'll break
    for some interactive coding fun!</p> <p>Terena Bell is CEO of <a href="http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php">In
    Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes
    a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces
    on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and
    Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies
    (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href="https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p>
    <p>Say the word "language" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But
    what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right
    to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and
    other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only
    should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization
    creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea
    to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages
    are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p>If
    you're considering joining, please read our rules, to determine if this group
