  description: <p>Interested in learning how to build Android apps with an awesome
    group of women? Looking to build your first app or build on existing skills? Come
    to our weekly Android Hack Night! We welcome women with all levels of Android
    experience (including none), but coding experience *is*preferred as Android is
    not the friendliest way to learn how to code. ***Please bring your laptop to this
    event as computers will not be provided.***</p> <p>Meetup Format</p> <p>This week
    we will be working on getting started with Android Studio. Please make sure that
    you have tried to install Android Studio on your laptop before you arrive! We
    will help with any installation issues, but it helps if you have already downloaded
    what you need. Building Access</p> <p>The management in certain buildings requires
    meetup hosts to let people in instead of relying on their security staff. Please
    respect the policy in case the location requires access to the building. To gain
    access, contact the group lead if information is provided or drop a comment on
    the meetup page. We'll come get you.</p> <p>Resources</p> <p>Beginners should
    check out our Android Getting Started Guide. It's chock full of information to
    get you up and running. It is a work in progress and we'll be adding as we go.
    Suggestions welcomed!</p> <p>All Women Welcome</p> <p><br/>This event is intended
    to be exclusively open for women; we are trans* friendly.</p> <p>Can't Come This
    Week, but Want to Stay in Touch?</p> <p>Please join our Slack group to talk about

  description: "<p>Simply put, the goal of any good data wrangler is to make data\
    \ more accessible.</p> <p>Consider the antithesis, the idea of hiding and obfuscating\
    \ your data but still publishing it on the web. Let\u2019s learn from the our\
    \ anti-hero, the black-hat data wrangler.</p> <p>Who wants to foil the data-wrangler?</p>\
    \ <p>A corporation required to publish financial data.</p> <p>A political campaign\
    \ with sensitive contributors lists.</p> <p>An industry heading toward regulation,\
    \ and would like to hide their status.</p> <p>A digital content provider that\
    \ displays the goods before a sale.</p> <p>A local government agency feeling the\
    \ burden of being forced to respond to FOIA requests.</p> <p>In this talk Travis\
    \ (organizer/Hack&amp;Tell) and Robert (organizer/Data Wranglers) will divulge\
    \ the dark secrets of black-hat wrangling. You\u2019ll learn the numerous ways\
    \ you can make data publicly available yet hard to obtain. In the spirit of a\
    \ good hacking talk, we\u2019ll discuss all the ways to defeat each tactic.</p>\
    \ <p>Join us in January! While you wait, share the worst dataset you\u2019ve ever\
    \ encountered in the meetup comments.</p>"

    \ <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes\
    \ to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the\
    \ audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback.\
    \ The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text\
    \ you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out\
    \ of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches,\
    \ no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting,\

  description: "<p>Hack &amp;&amp; Tell will be at WeWork Chinatown this month! Everyone\
    \ is looking forward to hearing about *your* cool hack. Presentation signups are\
    \ here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p>\
    \ <p>The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have *5* minutes\
    \ to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the\
    \ audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback.\
    \ The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text\
    \ you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out\
    \ of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches,\
    \ no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting,\
    \ complete this short form to let us know: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"\
    \ class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></p> <p>See you at the meetup!\
    \ We try to start on-time at 6:30. Sometimes we have free food (bonus!). Big thanks\
    \ to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you! We love hacks! &lt;3</p>"
