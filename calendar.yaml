    \ have just published an O'Reilly book called\_<a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035275.do\"\
    >Data Analytics with Hadoop</a>! \_Come celebrate the release of their book with\
    \ us, meet the authors, and mingle with your fellow data community members. \_\
    </p> <p>We will be holding a drawing to give away free copies of the book and\
    \ will also have print copies available that attendees can purchase at a discount.\
    \ \_</p> <p><br/>About the Book</p> <p>Ready to use statistical and machine-learning\
    \ techniques across large data sets? This practical guide shows you why the Hadoop\
    \ ecosystem is perfect for the job. Instead of deployment, operations, or software\
    \ development usually associated with distributed computing, you\u2019ll focus\
    \ on particular analyses you can build, the data warehousing techniques that Hadoop\
    \ provides, and higher order data workflows this framework can produce.</p> <p>Data\
    \ scientists and analysts will learn how to perform a wide range of techniques,\
    \ from writing MapReduce and Spark applications with Python to using advanced\
    \ modeling and data management with Spark MLlib, Hive, and HBase. You\u2019ll\
    \ also learn about the analytical processes and data systems available to build\
    \ and empower data products that can handle\u2014and actually require\u2014huge\
    \ amounts of data.</p> <p>\u2022\_Understand core concepts behind Hadoop and cluster\
    \ computing</p> <p>\u2022\_Use design patterns and parallel analytical algorithms\
    \ to create distributed data analysis jobs</p> <p>\u2022\_Learn about data management,\
    \ mining, and warehousing in a distributed context using Apache Hive and HBase</p>\
    \ <p>\u2022\_Use Sqoop and Apache Flume to ingest data from relational databases</p>\
    \ <p>\u2022\_Program complex Hadoop and Spark applications with Apache Pig and\
    \ Spark DataFrames</p> <p>\u2022\_Perform machine learning techniques such as\
    \ classification, clustering, and collaborative filtering with Spark\u2019s MLlib</p>\
    \ <p><br/>About the Authors</p> <p>Benjamin Bengfort\_is a Data Scientist who\
    \ lives inside the beltway but ignores politics (the normal business of DC) favoring\
    \ technology instead. He is currently working to finish his PhD at the University\
    \ of Maryland where he studies machine learning and distributed computing. His\
    \ lab does have robots (though this field of study is not one he favors) and,\
    \ much to his chagrin, they seem to constantly arm said robots with knives and\
    \ tools; presumably to pursue culinary accolades. Having seen a robot attempt\
    \ to slice a tomato, Benjamin prefers his own adventures in the kitchen where\
    \ he specializes in fusion French and Guyanese cuisine as well as BBQ of all types.\
    \ A professional programmer by trade, a Data Scientist by vocation, Benjamin's\
    \ writing pursues a diverse range of subjects from Natural Language Processing,\
    \ to Data Science with Python to analytics with Hadoop and Spark.</p> <p>Jenny\
    \ Kim\_is an experienced big data engineer who works in both commercial software\
    \ efforts as well as in academia. She has significant experience in working with\
    \ large scale data, machine learning, and Hadoop implementations in production\
    \ and research environments. Jenny (with Benjamin Bengfort) previously built a\
    \ large scale recommender system that used a web crawler to gather ontological\
    \ information about apparel products and produce recommendations from transactions.\
    \ Currently, she is working with the Hue team at Cloudera, to help build intuitive\
    \ interfaces for analyzing big data with Hadoop.\_</p>"

    \ and human tragedies.</p> <p>In the 90s Mark made the intrepid voyage across\
    \ the Atlantic via jet airplane to hold senior management positions with the BBC\u2019\
    s New York Bureau before transferring to US Public Radio, serving senior positions\
    \ at WNYC in New York, where he built a stellar reporting team that won the Edward\
    \ R. Murrow Award and the DuPont Columbia Award for investigative reporting. \_\
    After Mark left New York he became Programming Director WAMU in Washington, DC,\
    \ in this position he brought podcasting, internet streaming, and digital content\
    \ management to WAMU, expanding the station\u2019s range and increasing the listing\
    \ base dramatically.</p> <p>Mark is the founder and CEO of Birkdale Media, a boutique\
    \ media and public relations firm; Birkdale specializes in media coaching, interview\
    \ preparation, public relations for individuals and for corporations.</p> <p>Above\
    \ all else, Mark is a champion for data and data visualization in the newsroom\
    \ and on the air. \_We conducted an interview with him and were really impressed\
    \ by the passion he displayed for Data Viz \u2013 full text of the interview below:</p>\
    \ <p><br/>1) What got you into data visualization and how do you think data visualization\
    \ has enhanced your profession?\_</p> <p><b>Mark: </b>TV and Video Graphics have\
    \ become so much more sophisticated in the digital age that they can be designed\
    \ much more quickly, easily, and contain much more useful information for viewers,\
    \ helping producers to explain complex stories and issues, and put them into better\
    \ context than ever before. The internet means blogs, news-sites, etc. can contain\
    \ way more vital information\_and background than they did before - and many organizations\
    \ are utilizing data to enhance their story-telling, provide background, history,\
    \ and further detail.\_</p> <p>\n\n\n2) You worked for the BBC, how do you think\
    \ that working for an international news agency affected your views on data?\_\
    </p> <p><b>Mark:\_</b>In my day (80's and 90's) a sophisticated graphic could\
    \ take days, even weeks to assemble to be inserted into a news report. New technology\
    \ speeds this process meaning producers can make much better use of graphics on\
    \ video and on the web.\_</p> <p>\n\n\n3) How do you see data visualization shaping\
    \ the future of news media or vice versa how do you see news media shaping the\
    \ path of data visualization?\_</p> <p><b>Mark:\_</b>It opens up vast new possibilities\
    \ for journalism. Better analysis, better explanations and details in investigative\
    \ work (being able to collate and display complex documents, and show how they\
    \ relate to each other, for instance). The news media in turn can drive the quest\
    \ for big data using the Freedom of Information legislation on complex stories\
    \ and issues and making it public utilizing graphics and big data.\_</p> <p>\n\
    \n\n4) How do we make the news - print, media, digital, etc.- Great Again?\_</p>\
    \ <p><b>Mark:\_</b>By using our imagination about how to tell stories and raise\
    \ important issues in a more captivating and compelling way, rather than feeding\
    \ the public cheap consumer-driven news which is often second or third hand.\_\
    </p> <p>\n\n\n5) What international news story from the past decade could have\
    \ had a different outcome if data visualization was better used in covering it?\_\
    </p> <p><b>Mark:\_</b>Resolution from any conflict zone you care to mention -\
    \ by using big data to report it more accurately (Iraq, for example) thus raising\
    \ public awareness.\_</p> <p><br/><b>Sponsor Announcements: </b></p> <p><img src=\"\

  description: "<p>Over 6 billion emojis are sent each day, and within the past year,\
    \ emojis have begun finding their way into criminal cases as vital evidence because\
    \ of their semantic value. Emojis present difficulties for attorneys because they\
    \ can't be identified via keyword searches, and producing the rendered images\
    \ is both technically challenging with existing software but also highly subjective\
    \ due to the device-specific emojis used. This talk will explore some of the challenges\

    \ with these terms, let alone the details these topics.\_ Data volumes are growing\
    \ exponentially, the speed at which data crosses people's desks increases almost\
    \ daily, and the various types of data to be analyzed can be overwhelming.\_ The\
    \ industry has developed a powerful range of tools to store data and an equally\
    \ powerful range of tools to analyze data.\_ However, to date, there has not a\
    \ been significant amount of focus on careful preparation and active manipulation\
    \ of this data to allow for more thorough approaches to data and business analytics.\_\
    \ This presentation will cover relevant background and provide a foundation for\

    >Eventbrite</a>. Use the code WCM for $5 off.</p> <p>Networking isn't just for\
    \ jobs. It's for helping you with sales, funding, ideas and support. It's for\
    \ the long-term relationships that remind someone of you when they have a position\
    \ or allow you to reach out when you need an introduction. It's about building\
    \ professional connections that create value for you and for them. And sometimes\
    \ it's about building friendships.</p> <p>And if you aren't networking or aren't\
    \ doing it effectively...this class is for you.</p> <p><b>You should join us...</b></p>\
    \ <p><br/>- If you've ever felt awkward at a conference or a party, wondered how\
    \ to break into a conversation pod, pretended to be busy on your phone to hide\
    \ your shyness or otherwise wondered how to network in person</p> <p>- If you're\
    \ comfortable with people but never seem to close any deals or develop relationships\
    \ out of events</p> <p>- If you are considering a career change and need a refresher</p>\
    \ <p><i><b>**PLUS:\_</b></i>we have a practice session over food &amp; drinks!\
    \ <b>**</b></p> <p><b>How it works</b></p> <p>We start with class, have a practice\
    \ break with drinks &amp; food, unpack the experience in the 2nd session and then\
    \ hang out after to further sharpen skills.</p> <p><b>What we'll cover</b></p>\
    \ <p><i>Gearing up</i>: finding good networking opportunities, creating an introduction\
    \ and networking pitch, pre-event planning.</p> <p><i>Mechanics</i>: how to enter\
