  description: <p>Abstract:<br/>R has become the go-to environment to support data
    science and statistical applications across many fields. Researchers write papers
    in R, engineers develop runtime applications in R, and new statistical methods
    are first developed in R. Supporting this powerful environment is a complete programming
    language and a wealth of numerical analysis tools. R has a built-in matrix language
    that can solve mathematical problems above and beyond statistical regression.
    This talk will walk through R's tools for matrix manipulation, interpolation,
    integration, and root finding.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>James P. Howard, II</p>

  description: "<p><b>Visual Thinking</b></p> <p>For many of us \"data\" invokes thoughts\
    \ of the information age and the explosion of computing power. However, we don't\
    \ need computers to experience the data all around us, our world is a constant\
    \ source of streaming information, a first hand experience we capture with our\
    \ memories! For artists this begs the question, how else could we capture our\
    \ experiences? Memory is not a video recording of the world around us, so perhaps\
    \ there is another creative, external, approach. Data Viz is happy to introduce\
