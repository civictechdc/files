    \ Everyone is looking forward to hearing about *your* cool hack! Presentation\
    \ signups are here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"\
    \ class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>The format is informal,\
    \ engaging, and friendly: presenters have 5 minutes to show off their hack (it\
    \ goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask\
    \ questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people\
    \ present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a\
    \ walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show\
    \ us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects,\
    \ no deckware!</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short\
    \ form to let us know:\_<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"\
    \ class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>See you at the\
    \ meetup! We'll start close to 6:30. There may be a couple beers. It's going to\
    \ be fun! :) Big thanks to WeWork for hosting us! We love WeWork! We love you!\

  description: <p>The <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a> package
    for R provides a unified domain-specific language for tabular data. A powerful
    feature is that it supports multiple sources of tabular data, including data.frames,
    data.tables, and several dialects of relational database. But data.frames are
    not databases! How can this work? In this talk, I will dive into the details of
    how high-level dplyr verbs get translated into SQL, and walk through tips and
    tricks, optimizations, and gotchas.</p> <p><b>Our Instructor - Harlan Harris</b></p>
    <p>Data Scientist with experience and skills in Statistics and Statistical Programming,
    Machine Learning, Enterprise Software, Operations Research, Analytical Marketing,
    Enterprise Analytics, Higher Education, Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Modeling,
    Linguistics/Psycholinguistics, Artificial Intelligence, and more. Harlan applies
    statistical, mathematical, computational, and scientific methods to understanding
    how things, processes, and people work. He's also deeply involved in the data
    science professional community, and help organize professional events and services
    in the DC area.</p>
