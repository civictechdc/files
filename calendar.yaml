    \ <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p><b>Predicting and Understanding Law with Machine\
    \ Learning</b></p> <p>First, we present new methods to embed institutions and\
    \ their legal text into shared continuous vector space to enable novel investigations\
    \ into differences across institutions. Our model discerns meaningful differences\
    \ between government branches. The similarities between learned representations\
    \ of Congresses over time and sitting Presidents are negatively correlated with\
    \ the bill veto rate, and the temporal ordering of Presidents and Congresses was\
    \ implicitly learned from only text.</p> <p>Second, we describe <a href=\"http://predictgov.com/\"\
    >PredictGov</a>, a machine learning system for predicting Congress. Starting with\
    \ the 107th Congress, we trained models on data from previous Congresses, predicted\
    \ all bills in the current Congress, and repeated until the 113th Congress served\
    \ as the test. The median of the predicted probabilities for enacted bills was\
    \ 0.71, while the median of the predicted probabilities for failed bills was 0.01.\
    \ We also conducted a sensitivity analysis on the model to determine important\
    \ factors predicting enactment. We will describe these results and demonstrate\
    \ its interactive implementation for real-time predictions of the 114th Congress.</p>\
    \ <p><b>Bio:</b></p> <p><br/><b>John J. Nay</b></p> <p>John J. Nay is a Ph.D.\

    \ <p><br/>Data Wrangling and Data Preparation have emerged as key topics in the\
    \ world of Information Management and Business\_Analytics.\_ However, many people\
    \ are not familiar with these terms, let alone the details these topics.\_ Data\
    \ volumes are growing exponentially, the speed at which data crosses people's\
    \ desks increases almost daily, and the various types of data to be analyzed can\
    \ be overwhelming.\_ The industry has developed a powerful range of tools to store\
    \ data and an equally powerful range of tools to analyze data.\_ However, to date,\
    \ there has not a been significant amount of focus on careful preparation and\
    \ active manipulation of this data to allow for more thorough approaches to data\
    \ and business analytics.\_ This presentation will cover relevant background and\
    \ provide a foundation for understanding the business value of Data Wrangling.\_\
    \ Topics include:</p> <p><br/><b>What is Data Wrangling?</b></p> <p>\u2022\_Data\
    \ Wrangling vs. Data Preparation</p> <p>\u2022\_Market and Analyst Overview</p>\
    \ <p>\u2022\_Common Data Wrangling Tasks</p> <p>\u2022\_The Best Time and Place</p>\

    \ He has over 15 years of Business Intelligence and Data Visualization experience.\_\
    \ Data Wrangling and Data Preparation, in conjunction with visual analytics tools,\
