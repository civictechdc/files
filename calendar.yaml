    \ volume of digital data, in March 2012, the Obama Administration announced the\
    \ \u201CBig Data Research and Development Initiative.\u201D By improving our ability\
    \ to extract knowledge and insights from large and complex collections of digital\
    \ data, the initiative promises to help solve some the Nation\u2019s most pressing\
    \ challenges. \_At the launch of the initiative, the White House Office of Science\
    \ and Technology Policy (OSTP) and research funding agencies across the federal\
    \ government (including the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of\
    \ Health, Department of Energy, and many others) announced over $200M in new funding\
    \ opportunities for Big Data R&amp;D.</p> <p>Beginning in the second year of the\
    \ National Big Data Initiative, the Administration encouraged multiple stakeholders\
    \ including federal agencies, private industry, academia, state and local government,\
    \ non-profits, and foundations, to develop and participate in Big Data innovation\
    \ projects across the country. \_On November 12, 2013, dozens of public and private\
    \ organizations met at a White House-sponsored \u201CData to Knowledge to Action\u201D\
    \ event to announce an inspiring array of Big Data related collaborations-- answering\
    \ President Obama\u2019s call for partnerships that can enhance national priorities,\
    \ including economic growth and job creation, education and health, energy and\
    \ sustainability, public safety and national security, and global development.\
    \ \_In this talk, I will discuss some of the projects launched at the Data2Action\
    \ their recent outcomes and achievements, focusing on interdisciplinary collaborations\
    \ that focus on serving public and social good. \_I will also discuss new and\
    \ continuing Big Data programs being planned by NSF and other agencies in support\

  description: <p>Have you ever lost code and been really frustrated? Have you needed
    a line you wrote two days ago but saved over? Maybe you want to code with other
    people but are tired of sending zip files back and forth via email? Are you just
    getting started coding and want to learn best practices for how and where you
    should save it?</p> <p>This meetup will introduce you to Git, a version control
    system. This event is perfect for beginners as we'll show you the tool many developers
    use to collaborate and back up code. If you're a developer and you are not using
    a version control system, you should come out too as it's an absolute must for
    a developer's workflow.</p> <p>This event will be hands-on, so we encourage you
    to bring your laptops as we'll be doing real examples and practicing together.
    If you want to get ahead of the curve, you can sign up for a free account over
    at Github.com and start reading some of their documentation.</p>

  description: '<p>Sometimes it''s nice to take a break from the digital screens of
    our lives and bust out the pen and paper. Join us for an evening of drawing and
    tracing beautiful maps at this special Maptime.</p> <p>Inspiration and activities
    here: <a href="https://github.com/ddai/hand-drawn-maps" class="linkified">https://github.com/ddai/hand-drawn-maps</a>
    Don''t forget to bring your art supplies: sharpies, markers, crayons, highlighters,
    etc!</p> <p>**</p> <p>Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission
    is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating
    a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using
    mapping tools and technologies.</p> <p>This open learning environment for all
    levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime
    is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing
    projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.</p> <p>Inspiration
    for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models
    of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this
    space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects
    to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts,
    and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not
    do it together?</p> <p>For more information about Maptime, visit maptime.io. Also,
    follow us on twitter at @MaptimeDC.</p>'

  description: <p>With the diverse skills and interests of our group, let's explore
    how the experience in our backgrounds plays into our tech careers. For January,
    a founder will share the intersection of her subject matter expertise with tech,
    discussing how localization (fitting a site or piece of software to a culture,
    often including language) interacts with design and development. Then, we'll break
    for some interactive coding fun!</p> <p>Terena Bell is CEO of <a href="http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php">In
    Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes
    a monthly column for <i>MultiLingual Magazine</i> on the impact of societal macroforces
    on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization and
    Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies
    (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href="https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage">@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p>
    <p>Say the word "language" in tech circles, and people think Python or Ruby. But
    what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well as many others--read right
    to left, not thinking about foreign language now can lead to user interface and
    other development problems down the road. And that's just the beginning. Not only
    should (foreign) language impact HOW you design, but WHAT you design as globalization
    creates the need for more and more multilingual and translation apps. From idea
    to execution, Terena Bell, CEO of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages
    are just as essential to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p>If
