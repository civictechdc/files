    \ /></p> <p>\n\n\nPlease join us in June to hear how <a href=\"https://drill.apache.org/\"\
    >Apache Drill</a>\_can be used to query Hadoop, NoSQL and Cloud Storage.</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p>\
    \ <p>6:30 PM -- Networking &amp; Food\_</p> <p>6:55 PM -- Greetings</p> <p>7:00\
    \ PM --\_De-siloing data with Apache Drill<i>\_- </i>Charles S. Givre</p> <p>8:45\
    \ PM -- Post event drink</p> <p><b>Talks</b></p> <p><i>De-siloing data with Apache\
    \ Drill</i></p> <p>One of the problems which every enterprise faces is data-silos.\
    \ \_Breaking down these data silos can be extremely costly both in terms of time\
    \ and money, however Apache Drill offers a new approach which can de-silo data\
    \ without the need to redesign architecture. \_Drill is an open source, schema-free\
    \ SQL engine which can query all kinds of data including CSV files, JDBC/ODBC\
    \ databases, JSON, NoSQL, HDFS and more. \_Drill uses ANSI-SQL and is JDBC/ODBC\
    \ compatible as well, so that it can communicate results with BI tools such as\
    \ Splunk or Tableau. \_In this workshop, we will demonstrate how to use Drill\
    \ to query simple data, complex data and data from databases, and \"big data\"\
    \ sources. Finally we will cover how to write your own functions to extend the\
    \ functionality of Drill.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgivre\"\
    >Charles Givre</a> is an unapologetic data geek who is passionate about helping\
    \ others learn about data science and become passionate about it themselves. For\
    \ the\_last five years, Charles has worked as a data scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton\
    \ for various government clients and has done some really neat data science work\
    \ along\_the way, hopefully saving US taxpayers some money. Most of his work has\
    \ been in developing meaningful metrics to assess how well the workforce is performing.\
    \ For\_the last two years, Charles has been part of the management team for one\
    \ of Booze Allen Hamilton\u2019s largest analytic contracts, where he was tasked\
    \ with increasing\_the amount of data science on the contract\u2014both in terms\
    \ of tasks and people.Even more than the data science work, Charles loves learning\
    \ about and teaching new\_technologies and techniques. He has been instrumental\
    \ in bringing Python scripting to both his government clients and the analytic\
    \ workforce and has developed a\_40-hour Introduction to Analytic Scripting class\
    \ for that purpose. Additionally, Charles has developed a 60-hour Fundamentals\
    \ of Data Science class, which he has\_taught to Booz Allen staff, government\
    \ civilians, and US military personnel around the world. Charles has a master\u2019\
    s degree from Brandeis University, two bachelor\u2019s\_degrees from the University\
    \ of Arizona, and various IT security certifications. In his nonexistent spare\
    \ time, he plays trombone, spends time with his family, and works\_on restoring\
    \ British sports cars. Charles has a workshop on Drill at <a href=\"https://github.com/cgivre/drillworkshop\"\
    >Git</a>, can be reached at\_<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a>, blogs at\_\

    with research data, you have to be careful to protect user privacy. This can make
    it difficult to get hold of good data for testing. Truth Initiative has written
    a system for migrating sensitive data that protects user privacy while preserving
    useful properties for testing. We'll walk through the design of the system and
    how we met some of the challenges in building it.</p> <p><br/><b>Our Speaker</b></p>

    writes software to study better ways to help people quit smoking. He's also the
