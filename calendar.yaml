    >Loyola Columbia</a></p> <p>8890 McGaw Rd #230,\_Columbia,\_MD</p> <p><b>Directions</b></p>\
    \ <p>There is ample free parking surrounding the building.</p> <p><b>Talks</b></p>\
    \ <p><b>Collaborative Filtering For Recommendation Engines<br/></b></p> <p>Collaborative\
    \ filtering is a method of making automatic, personalized predictions about the\
    \ tastes of a user by collecting and leveraging the taste preferences from other\
    \ users. The basis of the method assumes that the if users are known to share\
    \ preferences for items, those users are more likely to have the same preference\
    \ for other items. The method has had success in a variety of web-based markets,\
    \ including Amazon, iTunes, Netflix, and LastFM. This talk covers the basics behind\
    \ the collaborative filtering algorithm, it\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and\
    \ ways to augment it to make better recommendation engines.</p> <p><br/><b>Building\
    \ Successful Data Science Applications</b></p> <p><br/>Data Scientists are under\
    \ constant pressure to deliver the latest and greatest analytics that save or\
    \ make organizations loads of money. In this talk, I will draw upon real-life\
    \ experience to see what it takes to deliver successful data science applications\
    \ in industry. Using an example from the telecommunications industry, I will show\
    \ what business leaders need to do to put their data scientists into a position\
    \ to succeed, and what a data scientist (or team of data scientists) should do\
    \ to deliver high quality, reliable, and reproducible results - whether they are\
    \ positive or negative. By walking through the life cycle of an analytics project\
    \ I present the techniques and processes that foster trust in analytics and pave\
    \ the way to putting your data science work into production.</p> <p><br/><b>Recognizing\
    \ Novel Images using Pre-trained Neural Networks</b></p> <p><br/>While there exist\
    \ many pre-trained neural networks to do image recognition, it is often of interest\
    \ to classify images that these general networks are not typically trained on.\
    \ \_Training a neural network from scratch, however, can be quite a finicky, time\
    \ intensive process. \_However, it is possible to use these pre-trained neural\
    \ networks as featurizers for novel images, and then to classify them using traditional,\
    \ out of the box supervised learning methods.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p>\
    \ <p><b>Patrick Roos</b>\_has two decades of industry and research experience\
    \ using machine learning, data mining, distributed systems, and modeling to generate\
    \ knowledge from data and tools to leverage it. He has a successful track record\

    \ <p>\u2022\_7:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>\u2022\_7:15pm -- Presentation\

    \ <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p><b>Meta-analysis: Synthesizing direct and indirect\
    \ effects of treatments, and some applications for big data analyses.</b></p>\
    \ <p>Meta-analyses are in the news!!! From affecting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat_and_cardiovascular_disease_controversy#Systematic_reviews\"\
    >what we choose to eat</a> to looking at <a href=\"https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/new-meta-analysis-confirms-no-association-between-vaccines-and-autism\"\
    >vaccines' impact on autism</a>, meta-analyses have an impact in improving our\
    \ knowledge and understanding, specially when a topic is confusing or has contradictory\
    \ results and views. It is a means of seeing the forest for the trees, distilling\
    \ and synthesizing the extant knowledge about a topic.</p> <p>Meta-analyses are\
    \ mainly seen in the world of biomedical research, so interest is in \"treatments\"\
    , namely drugs \_or particular diets or the like. However, \"treatments\" can\
    \ mean a marketing campaign or a behavioral intervention (like spanking) or a\
    \ change of a protocol. With that understanding, meta-analysis refers to the synthesis\
    \ of results from several small but comparable studies to derive overall estimates\
    \ of treatment effects that typically will be more robust and have higher statistical\
    \ power.\_</p> <p>Classical meta-analysis involves studies looking at the same\
    \ treatments to get an overall summary effect of one particular treatment effect.\
    \ Network meta-analysis can be modeled to utilize indirect comparisons to compare\
    \ the relative effectiveness of several different treatments of the same condition.\
    \ In this presentation I will describe both classical and network meta-analysis,\
    \ as well as the typical problems and biases one has to be aware of in doing meta-analyses.\
    \ The computations and weighting schemes used in meta-analysis can have direct\
    \ applications to implement a Divide-and-Conquer strategy so that modeling of\
    \ large data sets can be done in chunks and the results combined to get valid\
    \ results for the entire data set. I will describe an example from my experience\
    \ in fitting competing risks models to a large administrative data set.</p> <p><b>Bio:</b></p>\
    \ <p><br/><b>Abhijit Dasgupta</b></p> <p>Dr. Abhijit Dasgupta is a consulting\
    \ statistician/data scientist in the Washington DC metropolis. He is fascinated\
    \ by the innovative use of data analytic methods to gain insight and tell substantive\
    \ stories, using modern methods for modeling, simulation and visualization.</p>\
    \ <p>A PhD-level biostatistician by training, Dr. Dasgupta currently works to\
    \ bridge the statistics-machine learning divide, by merging machine learning methods\
    \ with sound statistical thinking and principles to help enhance our ability to\
    \ derive intelligence from data. He now has over 50 peer-reviewed research and\
    \ collaborative papers in areas ranging from bioinformatics, cancer research and\
    \ operations research to methods for cluster analysis and intelligent robust modeling.\
    \ He also consults for local startups doing bioengineering, business analytics\
    \ and bioinformatics. Dr. Dasgupta also helps train companies in using R for their\
    \ analytics needs, leveraging over 20 years experience using R and Python for\
    \ data analyses and reporting.</p> <p>Dr. Dasgupta also works to build the local\
    \ data community, organizing the Statistical Programming DC meet up and serving\
    \ on the Board of Data Community DC.</p> <p><b>Sponsors:</b></p> <p>This event\
