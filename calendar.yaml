    \ present are anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a\
    \ walk to [something more serious... like 3d-printing aluminum parts]. Show us\
    \ what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, dull work projects,\

    \ shadows. I'll show you how easy it is to use web fonts for typography (down\

    \ and better font support that makes our sites more visual appealing without using\
    \ font image replacement techniques, complex JavaScript, or graphics tools.</p>\

  description: "<p>This month we'll feature demos of three new tools that approach\
    \ mapping in new and interesting ways. Come out to see them in action presented\
    \ in five minute lightning talks. Here's our lineup:</p> <p>\u2022\_<a href=\"\
    https://twitter.com/nguyenist\">Stephanie Nguyen</a> will demo <a href=\"http://www.landmarkdirections.com\"\
    >Landmark</a>, a mobile app from <a href=\"http://silicalabs.com/\">Silica Labs</a>\
    \ for intuitive walking directions focused on photos of landmarks, not maps. Landmark\
    \ combines beautiful photos with a strong crowdsourcing community who are passionate\
    \ about their city and the architecture around them, all to provide directions\
    \ in a different way.</p> <p>\u2022\_Karl Phillips will show his work mapping\
    \ historical changes in cities around the country and demo how he's using <a href=\"\
    http://mapstory.org/\">MapStory</a> to crowdsource this work and release the data\
    \ openly.</p> <p>\u2022\_<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonnordling\">Jon Nordling</a>\
    \ will show off the <a href=\"http://geoodk.com/\">Geographical Open Data Kit</a>,\
    \ a mobile data collection and storing platform for geo-referenced information\
    \ that's fully open source.</p> <p>\u2022\_Trevor Gerhardt will demo &lt;a&gt;CarFreeAtoZ&lt;/a&gt;,\
    \ a commute planner <a href=\"http://conveyal.com\">Conveyal</a> has been building\
    \ for Arlington under their <a href=\"http://mobilitylab.org/tech/transit-tech-initiative/\"\
    >Transit Tech Initiative</a>, and will talk about using &lt;a&gt;OpenTripPlanner's&lt;/a&gt;\
    \ journey profiler and using public census data to analyze accessibility in a\
    \ region.</p> <p><br/>Come out at 7pm to grab a drink and bite to eat. We'll kick\
    \ off introductions and lightning talks at 7:30pm. There will be time after to\
    \ talk with our speakers and everyone else. <a href=\"http://stetsons-dc.com/index.php\"\
    >Stetsons</a> is a 21 and over venue. If you're not yet 21 but want to attend,\

  description: '<p>Sometimes it''s nice to take a break from the digital screens of
    our lives and bust out the pen and paper. Join us for an evening of drawing and
    tracing beautiful maps at this special Maptime.</p> <p>Inspiration and activities
    here: <a href="https://github.com/ddai/hand-drawn-maps" class="linkified">https://github.com/ddai/hand-drawn-maps</a>
    Don''t forget to bring your art supplies: sharpies, markers, crayons, highlighters,
    etc!</p> <p>**</p> <p>Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission
    is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating
    a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using
    mapping tools and technologies.</p> <p>This open learning environment for all
    levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime
    is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing
    projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.</p> <p>Inspiration
    for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models
    of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this
    space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects
    to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts,
    and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not
    do it together?</p> <p>For more information about Maptime, visit maptime.io. Also,
    follow us on twitter at @MaptimeDC.</p>'
