    >Eventbrite</a>. Use the code WCM for $5 off.</p> <p>Networking isn't just for\
    \ jobs. It's for helping you with sales, funding, ideas and support. It's for\
    \ the long-term relationships that remind someone of you when they have a position\
    \ or allow you to reach out when you need an introduction. It's about building\
    \ professional connections that create value for you and for them. And sometimes\
    \ it's about building friendships.</p> <p>And if you aren't networking or aren't\
    \ doing it effectively...this class is for you.</p> <p><b>You should join us...</b></p>\

    \ with Raspberry Pi and Kubernetes</p> <p>Subtitle: <b>Let's play real chaos monkeys</b></p>\
    \ <p><b>Description</b>: Kubernetes is a powerful, open source, container orchestration\
    \ / cluster management tool created by Google. It drew upon all the lessons learned\
    \ from a near-decade of using containers at Google. Kubernetes handles a number\
    \ of failure scenarios gracefully, from a crashed process, to a failure of a cluster\
    \ node. We'll show this through a real <b>Raspberry Pi</b> computing cluster that\
    \ runs <b>Kubernetes</b> - and play a real-life chaos monkey by pulling the plugs!</p>\
    \ <p>In this session, we'll look beyond container orchestration with Kubernetes,\
    \ but also demonstrate its failure handling by pulling the plugs on random nodes\
    \ from a <b>Raspberry Pi computing cluster</b>: - Overview of Kubernetes - Process\
    \ resource isolation to prevent a run-away process affecting another - Use Replication\
    \ controller to ensure a crashed process is restarted - Who wants to pull a network\
    \ or power plug from a computing cluster? <b>Let's play real chaos monkeys</b>.</p>\

    \ at Women Who Code: Algorithms on October 24th and you, too, will be able to\
    \ geohash like a pro. We will discuss use cases for geohashing and the math behind\
    \ how it works, and write a geohashing algorithm as a codealong (Python and Java\

    t know how to get started? Are you working for a product development team and\
    \ looking to get familiar with the lingo used by your colleagues to plan new products?</p>\
    \ <p>If any of those questions apply to you, then come to our event <i>Dev | Design:\
    \ Harmony in the Digital Space</i>. We\u2019ll start off with an interactive panel\
    \ discussion, where developers and designers together will analyze existing designs\
    \ and discuss their thoughts on the design; this discussion will present perspectives\
    \ from both development and design backgrounds. Then we will break out into four\
    \ roundtable discussion groups, each of which will discuss the following:</p>\
    \ <p>- Getting started on creating your portfolio<br/>- Designers helping developers\
    \ on the best way to design their portfolio<br/>- Developers helping designers\
    \ get their portfolio up on the web<br/>- Creating accessible designs</p> <p>Throughout\
    \ the event, there will be opportunities to network over food (gluten and vegetarian\
    \ options available) and drink. A list of available resources related to these\
    \ discussions will be placed in this Github repo after the event: <a href=\"https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/devdesign\"\
