    \ have just published an O'Reilly book called\_<a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035275.do\"\
    >Data Analytics with Hadoop</a>! \_Come celebrate the release of their book with\
    \ us, meet the authors, and mingle with your fellow data community members. \_\
    </p> <p>We will be holding a drawing to give away free copies of the book and\
    \ will also have print copies available that attendees can purchase at a discount.\
    \ \_</p> <p><br/>About the Book</p> <p>Ready to use statistical and machine-learning\
    \ techniques across large data sets? This practical guide shows you why the Hadoop\
    \ ecosystem is perfect for the job. Instead of deployment, operations, or software\
    \ development usually associated with distributed computing, you\u2019ll focus\
    \ on particular analyses you can build, the data warehousing techniques that Hadoop\
    \ provides, and higher order data workflows this framework can produce.</p> <p>Data\
    \ scientists and analysts will learn how to perform a wide range of techniques,\
    \ from writing MapReduce and Spark applications with Python to using advanced\
    \ modeling and data management with Spark MLlib, Hive, and HBase. You\u2019ll\
    \ also learn about the analytical processes and data systems available to build\
    \ and empower data products that can handle\u2014and actually require\u2014huge\
    \ amounts of data.</p> <p>\u2022\_Understand core concepts behind Hadoop and cluster\
    \ computing</p> <p>\u2022\_Use design patterns and parallel analytical algorithms\
    \ to create distributed data analysis jobs</p> <p>\u2022\_Learn about data management,\
    \ mining, and warehousing in a distributed context using Apache Hive and HBase</p>\
    \ <p>\u2022\_Use Sqoop and Apache Flume to ingest data from relational databases</p>\
    \ <p>\u2022\_Program complex Hadoop and Spark applications with Apache Pig and\
    \ Spark DataFrames</p> <p>\u2022\_Perform machine learning techniques such as\
    \ classification, clustering, and collaborative filtering with Spark\u2019s MLlib</p>\
    \ <p><br/>About the Authors</p> <p>Benjamin Bengfort\_is a Data Scientist who\
    \ lives inside the beltway but ignores politics (the normal business of DC) favoring\
    \ technology instead. He is currently working to finish his PhD at the University\
    \ of Maryland where he studies machine learning and distributed computing. His\
    \ lab does have robots (though this field of study is not one he favors) and,\
    \ much to his chagrin, they seem to constantly arm said robots with knives and\
    \ tools; presumably to pursue culinary accolades. Having seen a robot attempt\
    \ to slice a tomato, Benjamin prefers his own adventures in the kitchen where\
    \ he specializes in fusion French and Guyanese cuisine as well as BBQ of all types.\
    \ A professional programmer by trade, a Data Scientist by vocation, Benjamin's\
    \ writing pursues a diverse range of subjects from Natural Language Processing,\
    \ to Data Science with Python to analytics with Hadoop and Spark.</p> <p>Jenny\
    \ Kim\_is an experienced big data engineer who works in both commercial software\
    \ efforts as well as in academia. She has significant experience in working with\
    \ large scale data, machine learning, and Hadoop implementations in production\
    \ and research environments. Jenny (with Benjamin Bengfort) previously built a\
    \ large scale recommender system that used a web crawler to gather ontological\
    \ information about apparel products and produce recommendations from transactions.\
    \ Currently, she is working with the Hue team at Cloudera, to help build intuitive\
    \ interfaces for analyzing big data with Hadoop.\_</p>"

    \ Chief (1800 Massachusetts Ave NW) for How to Succeed in Data Driven Journalism\
    \ without Going Crazy. Our guest speaker for September will be trans-Atlantic\
    \ data journalism rock star, Mark McDonald. Mark\u2019s presentation will focus\
    \ on the data process in journalism, and how the information age has transformed\
    \ our abilities in storytelling and reporting. I will also appeal to journalists\
    \ to utilize the big data tools in their work as much as possible, leading to\

    \ Drinks</p> <p><br/><b>More about Mark McDonald </b></p> <p>A 30 year veteran\
    \ of the news industry, Mark has defined his career as a news producer by working\
    \ at the highest levels of international news, starting at the BBC TV News production\
    \ in the 80s, Mark served the BBC as a World Duty Editor, and in the field in\
    \ both Western and Eastern Europe, and extensively throughout North and South\
    \ America. While working for the BBC his work included coverage, both short and\
    \ long-form, of international politics, five U.S. Presidential elections, battlefield\
    \ conflict, diplomacy, the United Nations and its agencies, as well as natural\
    \ and human tragedies.</p> <p>In the 90s Mark made the intrepid voyage across\
    \ the Atlantic via jet airplane to hold senior management positions with the BBC\u2019\
    s New York Bureau before transferring to US Public Radio, serving senior positions\
    \ at WNYC in New York, where he built a stellar reporting team that won the Edward\
    \ R. Murrow Award and the DuPont Columbia Award for investigative reporting. \_\
    After Mark left New York he became Programming Director WAMU in Washington, DC,\
    \ in this position he brought podcasting, internet streaming, and digital content\
    \ management to WAMU, expanding the station\u2019s range and increasing the listing\
    \ base dramatically.</p> <p>Mark is the founder and CEO of Birkdale Media, a boutique\
    \ media and public relations firm; Birkdale specializes in media coaching, interview\
    \ preparation, public relations for individuals and for corporations.</p> <p>Above\
    \ all else, Mark is a champion for data and data visualization in the newsroom\
    \ and on the air. \_We conducted an interview with him and were really impressed\
    \ by the passion he displayed for Data Viz \u2013 full text of the interview below:</p>\
    \ <p><br/>1) What got you into data visualization and how do you think data visualization\
    \ has enhanced your profession?\_</p> <p><b>Mark: </b>TV and Video Graphics have\
    \ become so much more sophisticated in the digital age that they can be designed\
    \ much more quickly, easily, and contain much more useful information for viewers,\
    \ helping producers to explain complex stories and issues, and put them into better\
    \ context than ever before. The internet means blogs, news-sites, etc. can contain\
    \ way more vital information\_and background than they did before - and many organizations\
    \ are utilizing data to enhance their story-telling, provide background, history,\
    \ and further detail.\_</p> <p>\n\n\n2) You worked for the BBC, how do you think\
    \ that working for an international news agency affected your views on data?\_\
    </p> <p><b>Mark:\_</b>In my day (80's and 90's) a sophisticated graphic could\
    \ take days, even weeks to assemble to be inserted into a news report. New technology\
    \ speeds this process meaning producers can make much better use of graphics on\
    \ video and on the web.\_</p> <p>\n\n\n3) How do you see data visualization shaping\
    \ the future of news media or vice versa how do you see news media shaping the\
    \ path of data visualization?\_</p> <p><b>Mark:\_</b>It opens up vast new possibilities\
    \ for journalism. Better analysis, better explanations and details in investigative\
    \ work (being able to collate and display complex documents, and show how they\
    \ relate to each other, for instance). The news media in turn can drive the quest\
    \ for big data using the Freedom of Information legislation on complex stories\
    \ and issues and making it public utilizing graphics and big data.\_</p> <p>\n\
    \n\n4) How do we make the news - print, media, digital, etc.- Great Again?\_</p>\
    \ <p><b>Mark:\_</b>By using our imagination about how to tell stories and raise\
    \ important issues in a more captivating and compelling way, rather than feeding\
    \ the public cheap consumer-driven news which is often second or third hand.\_\
    </p> <p>\n\n\n5) What international news story from the past decade could have\
    \ had a different outcome if data visualization was better used in covering it?\_\
    </p> <p><b>Mark:\_</b>Resolution from any conflict zone you care to mention -\
    \ by using big data to report it more accurately (Iraq, for example) thus raising\
    \ public awareness.\_</p> <p><br/><b>Sponsor Announcements: </b></p> <p><img src=\"\

    \ for Hack&amp;&amp;Tell, we're trying a themed meetup with the amazing DC NLP\
    \ folks. This October, we're looking for presenters, speakers, and hackers for\
    \ anything related to human language, whether text, audio, videos of sign language,\
    \ etc... show us what you\u2019ve got! (remember: no startup pitches, dull work\
    \ projects, or deckware). The format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters\
    \ have *5* minutes to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect)\
    \ and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest\
    \ ideas and feedback.\_</p> <p>\n\n\n\nPresentation signups are below:<br/><a\

    \ bots, bonus points if they pass the Turing test and fight w/real people!</p>\
    \ <p>+ the weirdest take on a Turing test that you can come up with</p> <p>+ Haiku!</p>\
    \ <p>+ Automated assistant hacks, or how I got Cortana to break up with me</p>\
    \ <p><br/>+ Pen-testing (\"real\" hacking!) with deep learning NLP+ Linguistic\
    \ analysis of everyone's favorite anti-blog gawker</p> <p>+ Voice activation hacks,\
    \ like getting Alexa to order a pizza when my dog barks or find the nearest polling\
    \ place</p> <p>+ generating text based on your own email history (can you simulate\
    \ yourself? your friends?)</p> <p>+ unsupervised email classification (separate\
    \ into personal, work, whatever)</p> <p>+ recruit-bot: a bot that corresponds\
    \ with recruiters for arbitrarily long exchanges (Q-learning on real people?)<br/>+\
    \ multi-scale generative text (character + word??? + more?)</p> <p>+ sentiment\
    \ analysis for your work emails. Maybe don't read some of them right away.</p>\
    \ <p><br/>+ baby names, learned from pictures of other people's babies and their\
    \ names</p> <p>+ generate hack and tell ideas?!</p> <p>Does it have to be related\
    \ to human language? No, but if the speaking slots fill up, we will try to give\
    \ priority to NLP this month.\_</p> <p>See you at the meetup, at WeWork Chinatown.\
    \ This month we are starting at 6:30 with pizza and the talks will begin at 7:00.\_\

    \ Wrangling and Data Preparation have emerged as key topics in the world of Information\
    \ Management and Business\_Analytics.\_ However, many people are not familiar\
    \ with these terms, let alone the details these topics.\_ Data volumes are growing\
    \ exponentially, the speed at which data crosses people's desks increases almost\
    \ daily, and the various types of data to be analyzed can be overwhelming.\_ The\
    \ industry has developed a powerful range of tools to store data and an equally\
    \ powerful range of tools to analyze data.\_ However, to date, there has not a\
    \ been significant amount of focus on careful preparation and active manipulation\
    \ of this data to allow for more thorough approaches to data and business analytics.\_\
    \ This presentation will cover relevant background and provide a foundation for\
    \ understanding the business value of Data Wrangling.\_ Topics include:</p> <p><br/>What\
    \ is Data Wrangling?</p> <p>\u2022\_Data Wrangling vs. Data Preparation</p> <p>\u2022\
    \_Market and Analyst Overview</p> <p>\u2022\_Common Data Wrangling Tasks</p> <p>\u2022\

    \ <p>9:00 PM -- Post event drinks at Green Turtle</p> <p><b>Talks</b></p> <p><b>Fighting\
    \ Malware with Machine Learning - Ed Raff<br/></b></p> <p>This is a talk I will\
    \ be giving at Nvidia\u2019s GTC conference in DC. We have been performing research\
    \ with the Laboratory for Physical Sciences on how to apply machine learning to\
    \ detect malware, and to do so with minimal domain knowledge about binaries and\
    \ how they work. I\u2019ll be giving an overview about the problem, why its difficult\
    \ \u2013 especially compared to current ML tasks, and an overview of our current\
    \ and completed research toward that goal.</p> <p><br/><b>How to Build a Malware\
    \ Classifier [That Doesn't Suck on Real-world Data] - John Seymour</b></p> <p><br/>Machine\
    \ learning is the latest trend in malware classification. It's easy enough that\
    \ now everyone can spin up a malware crawler, extract some features from the files,\
    \ build some machine learning models, and publish their research in a reputable\
    \ journal. However, many of these models have issues with overfitting: they have\
    \ significant accuracy reductions on real-world data. We'll give a full introduction\
    \ on using machine learning to classify malware, including the features that are\
    \ currently used, which models seem to work best, and what datasets exist for\
    \ this purpose. We'll also demonstrate that even the best public malware classifiers\
    \ overfit to their original training sets. We'll end the talk with forays into\
    \ avoiding this issue, for creating malware classifiers that don't suck on real-world\
    \ data.</p> <p><br/><b>Speakers</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.edwardraff.com\"\

    \ both roles. He's mostly interested in avoiding and helping others avoid some\
    \ of the major pitfalls in machine learning, especially in dataset preparation\
    \ (seriously, do people still use malware datasets from 1998?) He has spoken at\

    >Github</a>. It is a Java library for machine learning, built out of my frustration\
    \ in using Weka. It aims to provide a more efficient and easier to use API, as\
    \ well as numerous algorithms. Many of the algorithms in JSAT are independent\
    \ implementations of common tools (such as linear SVMs, Lasso, and t-SNE) and\
    \ others are more niche or rarely available methods (such as Kernel k-means and\
