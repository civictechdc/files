    \ <p>Code &amp; Coffees are hosted bi-weekly. BYO-Projects and laptops for a fun,\
    \ informal way to learn, code and work on projects with other members in the community.\
    \ From Ruby on Rails to Javascript to CodeAcademy and HTML/CSS, these events are\
    \ open to all women or those who support women and minorities in tech. Feel free\
    \ to come early or stay later. These events are held at public coffee shops, so\
    \ good seats are on a first come first serve basis. Beginners welcome!</p> <p>Code\
    \ &amp; Coffees are not coding workshops. No instructors, no agenda, no lesson\
    \ plan. These events are very informal so ladies will usually bring their own\
    \ projects or meet people who are working on similar projects to collaborate together.\
    \ If you're a beginner we recommend some online tutorials like Code Academy or\
    \ General Assembly Dash. The hope is that you will find ladies who are learning\
    \ similar coding languages and projects to work with or ask questions.</p> <p>When\
    \ you arrive, we'll ask you to visit our Hackpad so we can all get to know a little\
    \ more about who is in the room! <a href=\"https://hackpad.com/Code-Coffee-no2YwWl8UVc\"\

    a line you wrote two days ago but saved over? Maybe you want to code with other
    people but are tired of sending zip files back and forth via email? Are you just
    getting started coding and want to learn best practices for how and where you
    should save it?</p> <p>This meetup will introduce you to Git, a version control
    system. This event is perfect for beginners as we'll show you the tool many developers
    use to collaborate and back up code. If you're a developer and you are not using
    a version control system, you should come out too as it's an absolute must for
    a developer's workflow.</p> <p>This event will be hands-on, so we encourage you
    to bring your laptops as we'll be doing real examples and practicing together.
    If you want to get ahead of the curve, you can sign up for a free account over
    at Github.com and start reading some of their documentation.</p>

    Don''t forget to bring your art supplies: sharpies, markers, crayons, highlighters,
    etc!</p> <p>**</p> <p>Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission
    is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating
    a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using
    mapping tools and technologies.</p> <p>This open learning environment for all
    levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime
    is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing
    projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.</p> <p>Inspiration
    for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models
    of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this
    space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects
    to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts,
    and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not
    do it together?</p> <p>For more information about Maptime, visit maptime.io. Also,

  description: "<p>In the new year, let's explore how the experience in our backgrounds\
    \ plays into our tech careers. For January, a founder will share the intersection\
    \ of her subject matter expertise with tech to talk about how localization interacts\
    \ with design and development. Then, we'll break for some interactive coding fun!</p>\
    \ <p>\n\n\nTerena Bell is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.ineverylanguage.com/index.php\"\
    >In Every Language</a>. She sits on the White House Business Roundtable and writes\
    \ a monthly column for\_<i>MultiLingual Magazine</i>\_on the impact of societal\
    \ macroforces on the translation industry. Terena is former Secretary of the Globalization\
    \ and Localization Association (GALA) and a former Association of Language Companies\
    \ (ALC) board member. She tweets as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InEveryLanguage\"\
    >@InEveryLanguage</a>.</p> <p>Say the word \"language\" in tech circles, and people\
    \ think Python or Ruby. But what about Urdu or Arabic? Since both these--as well\
    \ as many others--read right to left, not thinking about foreign language now\
    \ can lead to user interface and other development problems down the road. And\
    \ that's just the beginning. Not only should (foreign) language impact HOW you\
    \ design, but WHAT you design as globalization creates the need for more and more\
    \ multilingual and translation apps. From idea to execution, Terena Bell, CEO\
    \ of In Every Language, shows you why foreign languages are just as essential\
    \ to today's developer as coding languages are.</p> <p>\n\n\nIf you're considering\
