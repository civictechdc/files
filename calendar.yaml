    \ on applications of machine learning to real-world issues in cities! Matt Conway\
    \ will talk about his Data Science for Social Good Fellowship work, where he applied\
    \ Data Science techniques to properties in Memphis, and Jorge Mejia from UMD will\
    \ talk about a project that used Natural Language to help indentify restaurants\
    \ at risk of closure.\_</p> <p>Do you have a project that uses machine learning\
    \ to understand your city? Please let us know -- we'd love to publish a roundup\
    \ of other work in this domain on the DC2 blog!</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\
    \_6:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\_7:00pm -- Introduction,\

    \ <p>Identifying property distress and abandonment with administrative data</p>\
    \ <p><br/><i>Bio</i>: Matthew Wigginton Conway is a recent graduate of the University\
    \ of California, Santa Barbara, Department of Geography. This summer, he was fellow\
    \ in the Data Science for Social Good program at the University of Chicago, where\
    \ he worked with an interdisciplinary team applying data science to issues of\
    \ housing distress and abandonment in Memphis, Tennessee. He is now a transport\
    \ analyst and software developer in Washington, DC.</p> <p><i>Abstract</i>: Many\
    \ American cities are facing issues of housing distress and abandonment as the\
    \ economy evolves. One of the issues faced by these cities is simply knowing where\
    \ distressed properties are. This information is generally collected using windshield\
    \ surveys, driving down every street in the city and noting distressed properties.\
    \ Since these surveys are expensive, they cannot be performed often. Our team\
    \ applied a random forest to identify distressed properties based on administrative\
    \ data that is already collected annually, such as tax assessments and building\
    \ permits.</p> <p><br/>More Than Just Words: On Discovering Themes in Online Reviews\
    \ to Explain Restaurant Closures</p> <p><i>Bio</i>: Jorge Mejia is fourth-year\
    \ PhD candidate in the Decision, Operations and Information Technologies (DO&amp;IT)\
    \ Department at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland.\
    \ He holds a BS in Computer Engineering and a MS in Electronic Engineering from\
    \ Georgia Institute of Technology. Jorge's\_research focuses on social contagion\
    \ -- measuring and managing how information diffusion affects consumer behavior\
    \ and business outcomes. Please visit a recent profile from the\_<a href=\"http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/news/phd-candidate-profile-jorge-mejia\"\
    >University of Maryland.</a></p> <p><i>Abstract</i>: In this study, we complement\
    \ the existing research on online business reviews by proposing a novel use of\
    \ modern text analysis methods to uncover the semantic structure of online reviews\
    \ and assess their impact on the survival of merchants in the marketplace. We\
    \ analyze online reviews from 2005 to 2013 for restaurants in a major metropolitan\
    \ area in the United States and find that variables capturing semantic structure\
    \ within review text are important predictors of the survival of restaurants,\
    \ a relationship that has not been explored in the extant literature. We combined\
    \ machine learning approaches and econometric modeling to derive predictive models\
    \ that are significantly better than models that simply include numerical information\
    \ from reviews such as review valence, volume, word counts and readability.\_\

  description: '<p>Saturday? Yup, we are changing things up and swapping out pizza
    for bagels and other brunchy foods. Not only that, but we are joining forces with
    Data Science DC and District Data Labs to bring you this event!</p> <p>Please
    note that the event will be at GW but we have not finalized the exact space yet
    (so the address will likely change).</p> <p>Eight teams of DC data scientists
    have come together for a three month incubator to turn theory into practice on
    projects spanning healthcare, economics, the environment, and more. Learn from
    their experience implementing a Deep Learning network on commercially available
    hardware, on deploying a D3.js visualization web app using Heroku, or on building
    a desktop GUI with Python... plus much more! Enjoy brunch and drinks on us as
    we are taken from concept to production on eight data products, and then join
    the judges by voting for the winner! About our teams:</p> <p>SeeFish: Kathleen,
    Matt, and Chris are entering the Kaggle National Data Science Bowl, for which
    they must analyze underwater images to quantify plankton populations using Deep
    Learning systems.</p> <p>Group D: Constance, Vinoth, and Mike are developing an
    algorithm to accurately categorize overall ratings by the main contributing factor
    (e.g. service, food quality) as identified by the text in the corresponding review
    using a Yelp dataset.</p> <p>In collaboration with the Department of Labor:</p>
    <p>LaborMatch: Yunan, Keegan and Ali are combining BLS data with data via social
    media APIs to visualize skills-based supply/demand by geographic region and predict
    future trends in skill development using time-series and regression analysis.</p>
    <p>OKJK: Jim, Kathleen, and Oliver are working to form a suite of compressed economic
    indicators by geographic region using BLS data to improve understanding of economic
    health.</p> <p>PPM-Data: Patrick, Mehdi, and Paul are working to predict job growth
    using BLS economic data and regression analysis.</p> <p>Group B: Danielle, Elaine,
    Jing and Will are visualizing pockets of excess demand by industry, skill and
    resource using BLS data.</p> <p>In collaboration with HIMMS:</p> <p>The Synthesizers:
    Jamie, Kenneth and Bohan are working with HIMMS to add functionality to an open
    source data synthesizer to generate synthetic patient data sets with variable
    corruption by field.</p> <p>In collaboration with ZeroCycle:</p> <p>The Planeteers:
    Tony, Eyuel and Kate are optimizing attribution of recycling behavior to hyper
    local geographical regions using ZeroCycle and Census data.</p>'

  description: "<p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p> <p>Data quality is a fundamental issue\
    \ for data science that can be measured in many different ways.\_ Whether the\
    \ data is stored in a relational database, a hierarchical file, or in key/pairs,\
    \ the reliability of your analysis depends on the quality of the data involved.\_\
    \ In this talk, Joe Sremack will discuss what data quality is, the categories\
    \ in which data quality can be measured, and common data qualities issues.\_ Sample\
    \ data and Python code will be shown to illustrate what data quality issues are\
    \ and how they can be identified.</p> <p><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>\n\nJoe Sremack\
    \ is a Director in Berkeley Research Group\u2019s Technology Services Group.\_\
    \ He has spent over a decade performing digital investigations for some of the\
    \ largest civil and criminal cases in US History, such as the Bernie Madoff and\
    \ Allen Stanford Ponzi scheme investigations.\_ His work involves the collection\
    \ and analysis of organizations\u2019 data, where data quality is a frequent issue</p>\
