  description: <p>The <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a> package
    for R provides a unified domain-specific language for tabular data. A powerful
    feature is that it supports multiple sources of tabular data, including data.frames,
    data.tables, and several dialects of relational database. But data.frames are
    not databases! How can this work? In this talk, I will dive into the details of
    how high-level dplyr verbs get translated into SQL, and walk through tips and
    tricks, optimizations, and gotchas.</p> <p><b>Our Instructor - Harlan Harris</b></p>
    <p>Data Scientist with experience and skills in Statistics and Statistical Programming,
    Machine Learning, Enterprise Software, Operations Research, Analytical Marketing,
    Enterprise Analytics, Higher Education, Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Modeling,
    Linguistics/Psycholinguistics, Artificial Intelligence, and more. Harlan applies
    statistical, mathematical, computational, and scientific methods to understanding
    how things, processes, and people work. He's also deeply involved in the data

    \ than you\u2019d expect) and then the audience has 5 minutes to ask questions,\
    \ make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are\
    \ anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something\
    \ more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019\
