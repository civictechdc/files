  description: "<p>For our August Data Science DC Meetup, we're thrilled to have Brian\
    \ Muller from OpBandit (recently acquired by Vox) presenting about the algorithms\
    \ of Multi-Armed Bandit models and their importance in web content optimization.\
    \ Going beyond simple A/B testing, Bandit approaches continuously exploit the\
    \ knowledge they have learned about user preferences, maximizing value as they\
    \ learn. As a short postscript, Harlan Harris will talk about Bandit modeling\
    \ when preference data is incomplete and delayed. Expect to learn about tradeoffs\
    \ between exploration and exploitation, algorithms for continuous learning and\
    \ optimization, and how much of a difference they can make in practice.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p>\
    \ <p>\u2022\_6:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\_\
    7:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>\u2022\_7:15pm -- Presentations and\
    \ Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\_8:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>Tonic,\_2036 G St NW</i>)</p>\
    \ <p><b>Abstracts:</b></p> <p>1.</p> <p>At OpBandit, we built a service that renders\
    \ different versions of news content for rendering on top publishers across six\
    \ countries.\_ At a high level, whenever a reader requests a page on a publisher's\
    \ website, our service selects from multiple versions of headlines and photos\
    \ to deliver the collection of versions that we think a user is most likely to\
    \ click.\_ This requires decision making on the fly for each request, with hard\
    \ requirements for speed, reliability, and selection quality.\_ This talk will\
    \ cover the technical approaches we used (mostly solutions to the multi-armed\
    \ bandit problem) to make content version selections, as well as the product implications\
    \ of our choices and the results of each approach.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bamuller\"\
    >Brian Muller</a> is the Director of Data Science at <a href=\"http://www.voxmedia.com/\"\
    >Vox Media</a>.\_ Previously, he was the CTO and co-founder of <a href=\"https://opbandit.com/\"\
    >OpBandit</a> (acquired by Vox), a content optimization tool for online publishers.\_\
    \ Prior to founding OpBandit, he was the Lead Data Scientist at LivingSocial.\_\
    \ While at LivingSocial, he founded the data science team and oversaw the creation\
    \ and growth of a big data infrastructure and the teams necessary to support it\
    \ - all while the customer base grew from thousands to over 70 million users.\_\
    \ Before that, he worked as the Web Director for Foreign Policy Magazine under\
    \ the Washington Post.\_ He as a MS in the Biomedical Sciences, and has spent\
    \ time in academia working for the Medical University of South Carolina and Johns\
    \ Hopkins University School of Medicine focused on squeezing meaningful information\
    \ out of vast quantities of genomic data. Follow Brian on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bmuller\"\
    >@bmuller</a>.\_</p> <p><br/>2.</p> <p>Traditional multi-armed bandit optimization\
    \ relies on your getting feedback relatively quickly so that you can update your\
    \ utility function with improved estimates of the value of each option. This talk\
    \ will explore options for tackling the problem of bandit-like optimization when\

    \ these events are open to all women or those who support women and minorities\
    \ in tech. Feel free to come early or stay later. These events are held at public\
    \ coffee shops, so good seats are on a first come first serve basis. Beginners\
    \ welcome!</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees are not coding workshops. No instructors,\
    \ no agenda, no lesson plan. These events are very informal so ladies will usually\
    \ bring their own projects or meet people who are working on similar projects\
    \ to collaborate together. If you're a beginner we recommend some online tutorials\
    \ like Code Academy or General Assembly Dash. The hope is that you will find ladies\
    \ who are learning similar coding languages and projects to work with or ask questions.</p>\
    \ <p>Finding the building: The Mapbox Garage is at[masked]th St. Rear Entrance.\
    \ This is important. : ) You can only access our office through the alley behind\
    \ 14th, not from out front. The best way to get to us is to go to the corner of\
    \ 14th and R, walk west on R and then north up the alley. You'll see our sign\
    \ from R St and we're in a blue garage with glass doors.</p> <p>Code &amp; Coffees\

  description: "<p><b>What You'll Hear About</b></p> <p>R is a reliable and versatile\
    \ tool for data munging. Unfortunately, base R data load and transform processes\
    \ are slow for larger data sets.</p> <p>To alleviate this problem, the contributors\
    \ to the data.table package in R have rewritten many data flow tools in C, with\
    \ dramatic speed gains. Moreover, data.table can often do with one line what base-R\
    \ users would require a page of code for. This has come at the cost of a rather\
    \ demanding coding syntax.\_</p> <p>During this talk, I will try to partially\
    \ demystify data.table by going over a limited basic set of data.table operations,\
    \ benchmarking against base-R as I go. For even larger data.sets, using R for\
    \ ETL becomes unwieldly, so, time allowing, I will also attempt to demonstrate\
    \ a few basic uses of Pentaho's PDI toolset.</p> <p><b>About Our Speaker</b></p>\
    \ <p>Serban Tanasa is a managing director of Sunstone Science, a new innovative\
    \ Business Intelligence and Analytics startup in the DC Metro Area.</p> <p>A migrant\
    \ from the world of academia and international development, he is also serving\
    \ as the director of analytics and research at CSBS, where he is currently building\
    \ a BI solution from the ground up.</p> <p>Serban's hard at work bridging the\
    \ gap between traditional Business Intelligence and the new wave of analytics-heavy\
    \ methods surrounding Big Data.</p>"

    \ <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Introduction to Ruby:<br/></b></p> <p>Ready to start\
    \ programming? Want to learn one language that you can use to build web apps and\
    \ iPhone apps, do system administration, and security? Then you're ready to learn\
    \ Ruby.</p> <p>Ruby is an open source language that powers applications and products\
    \ like Hulu, LivingSocial, Groupon, and Github. There is a thriving, friendly\
    \ community of users, and the job market for developers is strong.</p> <p>Through\
    \ this five course series, you'll get a thorough introduction to programming fundamentals\
    \ with Ruby. We'll use the Interactive RuBy shell; write command line programs\
    \ that use loops, conditionals, methods, and classes; and learn the basics of\
    \ object oriented programming. We'll mix lecture and practice, and help guide\
    \ you through the coursework.</p> <p><b><i>We'll spend part of the first class\
    \ meeting setting up your development environment, so there's no need to install\
    \ software ahead of time. Just bring your laptop and be prepared to start coding!</i></b></p>\
    \ <p><br/><b>Outline of Sessions:</b></p> <p><br/><b>Class 1 -\_Intro to programming\
    \ in Ruby\_(2 hours, 7-9p)</b></p> <p>What is programming? What is Ruby? We'll\
    \ give you some context for the class, then dive right into writing code! Using\
    \ the Interactive Ruby Shell, we'll begin experimenting with variables, methods,\
    \ and data types. We'll end the class by writing a little interactive command\
    \ line program.</p> <p><b><a href=\"https://github.com/azelma/gdi-ruby#class-2\"\
    >&lt;/a&gt;Class 2 -\_</b></p> <p>Structured programming (loops and conditions),\
    \ working with collections data types\_\_(2 hours, 7-9p)</p> <p>We'll create small\
    \ programs in the text editor that use conditionals and loops for control flow.\
    \ Then, we'll explore Ruby's collections data types, and see some of the ways\
    \ we can work with them.</p> <p><b>&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/azelma/gdi-ruby#class-3\"\
    &gt;</a>Class 3 -\_</b></p> <p>Object Oriented Programming, part I\_\_(2 hours,\
    \ 7-9p)</p> <p>We'll discuss the basic concepts of object oriented programming.\
    \ We'll write our own methods, and explore some of the predefined methods that\
    \ are available in Ruby for certain classes of object.</p> <p><b>&lt;a href=\"\
    https://github.com/azelma/gdi-ruby#class-4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Class 4 -\_</b></p>\
    \ <p>Object Oriented Programming, part II\_\_(2 hours, 7-9p)</p> <p>We will expand\
    \ our knowledge of OOP by discussing classes and inheritance. We will tie together\
    \ everything we've learned with a relatively complex, totally fun final project.</p>\

  description: "<p>For our September meetup we're honored to welcome <b>Dr. Hadley\
    \ Wickham</b> (@hadleywickham), the author of several highly used packages in\
    \ R, including dplyr, tidyr, stringr, devtools and ggplot2.\_</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b><br/>A\
    \ fluent interface lets you easily express yourself in code. Over time a fluent\
    \ interface retreats to your subconcious. You don't need to bring it to mind;\
    \ the code just flows out of your fingers. I strive for this fluency in all the\
    \ packages I write, and while I don't always succeed, I think I've learned some\
    \ valuable lessons along the way.</p> <p>In this talk, I'll discuss three guidelines\
    \ that make it easier to develop fluent interfaces:</p> <p>* __Pure functions__.\
    \ A pure function only interacts with the world through its inputs and outputs;\
    \ it has no side-effects. Pure functions make great building blocks because they're\
    \ are easy to reason about and can be easily composed.</p> <p>* __Predictable\
    \ interfaces__. It's easier to learn a function if its consistent, because you\
    \ can learn the behaviour of a whole group of functions at once. I'll highlight\
    \ the benefits of predictability with some of my favourite R \"WAT\"s (including\
    \ `c()`, `sapply()` and `sample()`).</p> <p>* __Pipes__. Pure predictable functions\
    \ are nice in isolation but are most powerful in combination. The pipe, `%&gt;%`,\
    \ is particularly in important when combining many functions because it turns\
    \ function composition on its head so you can read it from left-to-right. I'll\
    \ show you how this has helped me build dplyr, rvest, ggvis, lowliner, stringr\
    \ and more.</p> <p>This talk will help you make best use of my recent packages,\
    \ and teach you how to apply the same principles to make your own code easier\
    \ to use.</p> <p><b>Speaker Information: </b><br/>Hadley is Chief Scientist at\
    \ RStudio and Adjunct Professor of Statistics at Rice University. He is interested\
    \ in building better tools for data science. His work includes R packages for\
    \ data analysis (ggplot2, plyr, reshape2); packages that make R less frustrating\
    \ (lubridate for dates, stringr for strings, httr for accessing web APIs); and\
    \ that make it easier to do good software development in R (roxygen2, testthat,\
    \ devtools, lineprof, staticdocs). He is also a writer, educator, and frequent\
    \ contributor to conferences promoting more accessible and more effective data\
    \ analysis.</p>"

  description: <p>The <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a> package
    for R provides a unified domain-specific language for tabular data. A powerful
    feature is that it supports multiple sources of tabular data, including data.frames,
    data.tables, and several dialects of relational database. But data.frames are
    not databases! How can this work? In this talk, I will dive into the details of
    how high-level dplyr verbs get translated into SQL, and walk through tips and
    tricks, optimizations, and gotchas.</p> <p><b>Our Instructor - Harlan Harris</b></p>
    <p>Data Scientist with experience and skills in Statistics and Statistical Programming,
    Machine Learning, Enterprise Software, Operations Research, Analytical Marketing,
    Enterprise Analytics, Higher Education, Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Modeling,
    Linguistics/Psycholinguistics, Artificial Intelligence, and more. Harlan applies
    statistical, mathematical, computational, and scientific methods to understanding
    how things, processes, and people work. He's also deeply involved in the data

    \ make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback. The hacks that people present are\
    \ anything from how to train your dog to text you when it needs a walk to [something\
    \ more serious... like blenders made out of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019\
    ve got! But remember: no startup pitches, no dull work projects, no deckware!</p>\

    \ Everyone is looking forward to hearing about *your* cool hack! Presentation\
    \ signups are here:</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\

    \n\n\n\n\nThe format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have 5 minutes\
    \ to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the\
    \ audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback.\
    \ The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text\
    \ you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out\
    \ of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches,\
    \ no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in presenting, complete this short form\
    \ to let us know:\_<a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/presentatdc\"\
    \ class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/presentatdc</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee you at the meetup! We'll start close to seven.\
    \ There may be a couple beers. It's going to be fun! :) Big thanks to WeWork for\
