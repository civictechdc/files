    \ for data science that can be measured in many different ways.\_ Whether the\
    \ data is stored in a relational database, a hierarchical file, or in key/value\
    \ pairs, the reliability of your analysis depends on the quality of the data involved.\_\
    \ In this talk, Joe Sremack will discuss what data quality is, the categories\
    \ in which data quality can be measured, and common data quality issues.\_ Sample\
    \ data and Python code will be shown to illustrate what data quality issues are\
    \ and how they can be identified.</p> <p><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Joe Sremack\

    \ <p><br/>1. Pulling in meetup info into the PyLadies website</p> <p>2. Creating\
    \ an app that provides easy ways for folks to jump into projects to learn how\

    \ the other way around, and/or having stats about diversity at companies that\
    \ are publicly available.\_</p> <p>Before this meetup, I will try to send out\

    \ Maryland working at the cutting edge of the analysis of behavior in social media.\
    \ Hadi Amiri will talk about predicting interactions between brands and consumers,\
    \ while Bill Rand will talk about fitting agent-based and other models to Twitter\

    \ <p><i>Brandtology in Social Media</i></p> <p>User generated contents in social\
    \ media platforms provide important and timely indicators on the spontaneous and\
    \ often genuine views of users, fans, and customers on a wide range of topics.\
    \ It is thus invaluable to obtain actionable insights from such live streaming\
    \ contents. In this talk, I introduce Brandtology in social media: the science\
    \ of studying brands, customers, and the interaction between the two in the context\
    \ of social networks. I will talk about two issues of predictability in Brandtology,\
    \ namely churn prediction and emerging topic detection for brands in social media.</p>\
    \ <p><a href=\"http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hadi/index.html\">Hadi Amiri</a> is\
    \ currently a Postdoc at the University of Maryland, Institute for Advanced Computer\
    \ Studies (UMIACS). He is affiliated with the Computational Linguistics &amp;\
    \ Information Processing (CLIP) lab. His primary research interests are in the\
    \ areas of Social Media Analysis and Natural Language Processing, and his current\
    \ work centers on understanding exposition in the context of social networks.\
    \ He received his PhD from the National University of Singapore in 2013 and worked\
    \ as a Research Scientist at the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) from 2013-2014.\

    \ <p><br/><i>Using Big Data and Agent-Based Modeling to Understand and Predict\
    \ Social Media Diffusion</i></p> <p><br/>With the increasing abundance of `digital\
    \ footprints' left by human interactions in online environments, e.g., social\
    \ media and app use, the ability to model such behavior has become increasingly\
    \ possible. Many approaches have been proposed, however, most previous model frameworks\
    \ are fairly restrictive, and often the models are not directly compared on a\
    \ diverse collection of human behavior. We will<br/>explore a new modeling approach\
    \ that enables the creation of models directly from data with no previous restrictions\
    \ on the data. We will examine this modeling framework in the context of predictive\
    \ and descriptive abilities on a heterogeneous catalog of human behavior collected\
    \ from fifteen thousand users on Twitter. We find that despite<br/>the popularity\
    \ of exogenous drive-type models,\_ for explaining digitally-mediated human behavior,\
    \ most users are better modeled using self- or socially-driven models. Our work\
    \ highlights the importance of a flexible modeling approach when attempting to\
    \ explain and predict<br/>human behavior in digital environments.</p> <p><br/><a\
    \ href=\"http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/william-rand\">William Rand</a>\
    \ examines the use of computational modeling techniques, like agent-based modeling,\
    \ geographic information systems, social network analysis, and machine learning,\
    \ to help understand and analyze complex systems, such as the diffusion of innovation,\
    \ organizational learning, and economic markets. He serves as the Director of\
    \ the<br/>Center for Complexity in Business, the first academic research center\
    \ focused solely on the application of complex systems techniques to business\
    \ applications and management science. Over the course of his research experience,\
    \ he has used computer models to help understand a large variety of complex systems,\
    \ such as the evolution of cooperation, suburban sprawl, traffic patterns, financial\
    \ systems, land-use and land-change in urban systems, and many other phenomena.\
    \ He has recently received research awards from DARPA, Google, WPP, the<br/>National\
    \ Science Foundation and the Marketing Science Institute. Follow Bill on Twitter\

  description: "<p>For our second June Data Science DC Meetup (making up for a skipped\
    \ May!), we're very pleased to have a presentation by Prof. Wei-Yin Loh from the\
    \ Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and (for the\
    \ summer) the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Dr. Loh recently wrote a <a href=\"\
    http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/insr.12016/abstract\">comprehensive\
    \ review</a> of the history of Classification and Regression Trees, a fundamental\
    \ technique in applied statistics, machine learning, and data science, and will\
    \ present his work for us. This will be a great event whether you're new to decision\
    \ trees, or whether you want to hear about the back-story and the state of the\
    \ art!</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>\u2022\_6:30pm -- Networking, Empanadas, and\
    \ Refreshments</p> <p>\u2022\_7:00pm -- Introduction, Announcements</p> <p>\u2022\
    \_7:15pm -- Presentation and Discussion</p> <p>\u2022\_8:30pm -- Data Drinks (<i>Tonic,\_\
    2036 G St NW</i>)</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>It has been 52 years since the\
    \ publication of AID (Morgan and Sonquist, 1963), the first regression tree algorithm.\
    \ Owing to its novelty at the time and to the many questions it left unanswered,\
    \ the paper was met with mostly criticism and cynicism. As a result, little progress\
    \ was made until the appearance two decades later of CHAID (Kass, 1980), CART\
    \ (Breiman et al., 1984), ID3 (Quinlan, 1986), and FACT (Loh and Vanichsetakul,\
    \ 1988). These second-generation methods brought new ideas that resolved many\
    \ of the issues of AID, but they also revealed some fundamental computational\
    \ and statistical problems of their own. Research accelerated over the last two\
    \ decades, being spurred almost simultaneously by the rapid increase in computing\
    \ power, the rapid growth in the size and complexity of data sets, and the desire\
    \ for more flexible statistical techniques. This talk will give a brief critical\
    \ review of the history of the subject and the current state-of-the-art algorithms.</p>\
    \ <p><br/><b>Bio:</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~loh/index.html\"\
    >Wei-Yin Loh</a> is Professor of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\
    \ He has been developing algorithms for classification and regression trees for\_\

  description: "<p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p> <p>This talk serves as an extremely\
    \ basic introduction to retrieving data from Hadoop, with a special focus on HBase\
    \ (the Hadoop Database). Using Pig, non-developers can gather data from the seemingly\
    \ unwieldy HBase, freeing them to analyze that data with their tool of choice\
    \ (e.g., Excel, Python). Note: there\u2019s no getting around coding, but if you\
    \ can write an Excel formula you can write Pig.\_</p> <p>We will begin with a\
    \ quick and dirty overview of Hadoop and NoSQL databases, with a specific focus\
    \ on HBase because its flexible schema presents a challenge to Pig beginners.\
    \ You will learn how to use some short, very kludgy python in the form of a user\
    \ defined function (UDF) to get around this problem. By the end of this talk,\
    \ individuals new to code should feel emboldened to start retrieving data from\
    \ Hadoop.</p> <p><b>Our Speaker</b></p> <p>Gus Cavanaugh is a recovering business\
    \ major who once sought recognition as a thought leader without realizing how\
    \ Orwellian it sounded to lead someone\u2019s thoughts. To that end, he honed\
    \ his ability to make copies, rush around the office, tie a full windsor knot,\
    \ and nod his head in a sign of vigorous agreement whenever his seniors sought\
    \ buy-in around a new strategy of leveraging core competencies. While he has barely\
    \ risen from his nadir, he no longer views the powerpoint deck as the ultimate\
    \ expression of business acumen and realizes it can be fun to actually build something\
    \ rather than just speculate.</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p>6:30 - Food and beverages</p>\
    \ <p>7:00 - Intro and announcements</p> <p>7:15 - Talk</p> <p>8:30 - Head to Tonic\
    \ for drinks</p>"

  description: <p>The <a href="https://github.com/hadley/dplyr">dplyr</a> package
    for R provides a unified domain-specific language for tabular data. A powerful
    feature is that it supports multiple sources of tabular data, including data.frames,
    data.tables, and several dialects of relational database. But data.frames are
    not databases! How can this work? In this talk, I will dive into the details of
    how high-level dplyr verbs get translated into SQL, and walk through tips and
    tricks, optimizations, and gotchas.</p> <p><b>Our Instructor - Harlan Harris</b></p>
    <p>Data Scientist with experience and skills in Statistics and Statistical Programming,
    Machine Learning, Enterprise Software, Operations Research, Analytical Marketing,
    Enterprise Analytics, Higher Education, Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Modeling,
    Linguistics/Psycholinguistics, Artificial Intelligence, and more. Harlan applies
    statistical, mathematical, computational, and scientific methods to understanding
    how things, processes, and people work. He's also deeply involved in the data
    science professional community, and help organize professional events and services

  description: "<p>Hack and Tell will be at WeWork Chinatown again in December! (Hooray!)\
    \ Everyone is looking forward to hearing about *your* cool hack! Presentation\
    \ signups are here:</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"\

    \n\n\n\n\nThe format is informal, engaging, and friendly: presenters have 5 minutes\
    \ to show off their hack (it goes faster than you\u2019d expect) and then the\
    \ audience has 5 minutes to ask questions, make jokes, and suggest ideas and feedback.\
    \ The hacks that people present are anything from how to train your dog to text\
    \ you when it needs a walk to [something more serious... like blenders made out\
    \ of artichokes]. Show us what you\u2019ve got! But remember: no startup pitches,\
    \ no dull work projects, no deckware!</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
