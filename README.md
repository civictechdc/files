Files
=====

These files are used in other Code for DC projects, but needed a place to live. Here's what they are:

`civic.json.template`: a template for the `civic.json` files used to power Code for DC's projects page.

`specification.md`: an explanation of how the `civic.json` file works.

`projects.json`: the data about our projects to power `projects.html` on [codefordc.org]().

`tracked.json`: the names and repo addresses of all of our projects.

`calendar.json`: meeting information for Code for DC and various other local groups.
